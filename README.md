# AI Discussion Notes

### Difference between AI, ML and AGI
- **Artificial General Intelligence:**
  - Machines that are like ourselves, capable of self-reflection, emotion, violence and creations. Machines that could, in essence, replace us
  - This is essentially the "goal post" of machine intelligence
  - The reality is, we're not there yet and we're still pretty far from it
- **Machine Learning:**
  - A field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed (Arthur Samuel, 1959)
- **Artificial Intelligence:**
  - The theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence, such as visual perception, sppech recognition, decision-making and translation between languages (English Oxford Living)
  - Notice the note on being able to *perform* ... did not say *learn* 
  - AI can exist without including machine learning

### AI Over Time
- **Pre 1950s:** Limited achievements until electronic computation became possible during WWII
- **1950s - 1960s:** Golden age of AI (Perceptron, MLP, etc created during this time)
- **1970s:** AI Winter
- **1980s:** Narrow AI Boom
- **1990s:** Neural Network Renaissance
- **2000s:** Cheap Computers
- **2010s:** Modern Neural Network Frameworks

### AI Achievements in Games
- **1994:** Checkers
- **1997:** Chess
- **2006:** Jeapordy!
- **2016:** Go
- **2018:** StarCraft

## Sprint Challenge Prep:

- LSTM text classification
- structure model, use appropriate loss functions and optimizers
- using pretrained CNN for inference (similar to in-class project Tuesday)
- written questions on auto-encoders
- written questions on AI discussion
