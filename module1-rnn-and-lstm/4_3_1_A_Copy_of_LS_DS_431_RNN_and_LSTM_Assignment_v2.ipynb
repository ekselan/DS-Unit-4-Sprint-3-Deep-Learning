Rossillon. A room in the Countess’s palace.\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Bertram, the Countess of Rossillon, Helena, and Lafew, all in\\r\\n black.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nIn delivering my son from me, I bury a second husband.\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nAnd I in going, madam, weep o’er my father’s death anew; but I must\\r\\nattend his majesty’s command, to whom I am now in ward, evermore in\\r\\nsubjection.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nYou shall find of the king a husband, madam; you, sir, a father. He\\r\\nthat so generally is at all times good, must of necessity hold his\\r\\nvirtue to you, whose worthiness would stir it up where it wanted,\\r\\nrather than lack it where there is such abundance.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nWhat hope is there of his majesty’s amendment?\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nHe hath abandon’d his physicians, madam; under whose practices he hath\\r\\npersecuted time with hope, and finds no other advantage in the process\\r\\nbut only the losing of hope by time.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nThis young gentlewoman had a father—O that “had!”, how sad a passage\\r\\n’tis!—whose skill was almost as great as his honesty; had it stretch’d\\r\\nso far, would have made nature immortal, and death should have play for\\r\\nlack of work. Would for the king’s sake he were living! I think it\\r\\nwould be the death of the king’s disease.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nHow called you the man you speak of, madam?\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nHe was famous, sir, in his profession, and it was his great right to be\\r\\nso: Gerard de Narbon.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nHe was excellent indeed, madam; the king very lately spoke of him\\r\\nadmiringly, and mourningly; he was skilful enough to have liv’d still,\\r\\nif knowledge could be set up against mortality.\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nWhat is it, my good lord, the king languishes of?\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nA fistula, my lord.\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nI heard not of it before.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nI would it were not notorious. Was this gentlewoman the daughter of\\r\\nGerard de Narbon?\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nHis sole child, my lord, and bequeathed to my overlooking. I have those\\r\\nhopes of her good that her education promises her dispositions she\\r\\ninherits, which makes fair gifts fairer; for where an unclean mind\\r\\ncarries virtuous qualities, there commendations go with pity, they are\\r\\nvirtues and traitors too. In her they are the better for their\\r\\nsimpleness; she derives her honesty, and achieves her goodness.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nYour commendations, madam, get from her tears.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\n’Tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise in. The remembrance\\r\\nof her father never approaches her heart but the tyranny of her sorrows\\r\\ntakes all livelihood from her cheek. No more of this, Helena; go to, no\\r\\nmore, lest it be rather thought you affect a sorrow than to have.\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nI do affect a sorrow indeed, but I have it too.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nModerate lamentation is the right of the dead; excessive grief the\\r\\nenemy to the living.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nIf the living be enemy to the grief, the excess makes it soon mortal.\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nMadam, I desire your holy wishes.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nHow understand we that?\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nBe thou blest, Bertram, and succeed thy father\\r\\nIn manners, as in shape! Thy blood and virtue\\r\\nContend for empire in thee, and thy goodness\\r\\nShare with thy birthright! Love all, trust a few,\\r\\nDo wrong to none. Be able for thine enemy\\r\\nRather in power than use; and keep thy friend\\r\\nUnder thy own life’s key. Be check’d for silence,\\r\\nBut never tax’d for speech. What heaven more will,\\r\\nThat thee may furnish and my prayers pluck down,\\r\\nFall on thy head! Farewell. My lord,\\r\\n’Tis an unseason’d courtier; good my lord,\\r\\nAdvise him.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nHe cannot want the best\\r\\nThat shall attend his love.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nHeaven bless him! Farewell, Bertram.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exit Countess._]\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nThe best wishes that can be forg’d in your thoughts be servants to you!\\r\\n[_To Helena._] Be comfortable to my mother, your mistress, and make\\r\\nmuch of her.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nFarewell, pretty lady, you must hold the credit of your father.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exeunt Bertram and Lafew._]\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nO, were that all! I think not on my father,\\r\\nAnd these great tears grace his remembrance more\\r\\nThan those I shed for him. What was he like?\\r\\nI have forgot him; my imagination\\r\\nCarries no favour in’t but Bertram’s.\\r\\nI am undone: there is no living, none,\\r\\nIf Bertram be away. ’Twere all one\\r\\nThat I should love a bright particular star,\\r\\nAnd think to wed it, he is so above me.\\r\\nIn his bright radiance and collateral light\\r\\nMust I be comforted, not in his sphere.\\r\\nTh’ambition in my love thus plagues itself:\\r\\nThe hind that would be mated by the lion\\r\\nMust die for love. ’Twas pretty, though a plague,\\r\\nTo see him every hour; to sit and draw\\r\\nHis arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls,\\r\\nIn our heart’s table,—heart too capable\\r\\nOf every line and trick of his sweet favour.\\r\\nBut now he’s gone, and my idolatrous fancy\\r\\nMust sanctify his relics. Who comes here?\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Parolles.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne that goes with him: I love him for his sake,\\r\\nAnd yet I know him a notorious liar,\\r\\nThink him a great way fool, solely a coward;\\r\\nYet these fix’d evils sit so fit in him\\r\\nThat they take place when virtue’s steely bones\\r\\nLooks bleak i’ th’ cold wind: withal, full oft we see\\r\\nCold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nSave you, fair queen!\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nAnd you, monarch!\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nNo.\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nAnd no.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nAre you meditating on virginity?\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nAy. You have some stain of soldier in you; let me ask you a question.\\r\\nMan is enemy to virginity; how may we barricado it against him?\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nKeep him out.\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nBut he assails; and our virginity, though valiant, in the defence, yet\\r\\nis weak. Unfold to us some warlike resistance.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nThere is none. Man setting down before you will undermine you and blow\\r\\nyou up.\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nBless our poor virginity from underminers and blowers-up! Is there no\\r\\nmilitary policy how virgins might blow up men?\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nVirginity being blown down, man will quicklier be blown up; marry, in\\r\\nblowing him down again, with the breach yourselves made, you lose your\\r\\ncity. It is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to preserve\\r\\nvirginity. Loss of virginity is rational increase, and there was never\\r\\nvirgin got till virginity was first lost. That you were made of is\\r\\nmetal to make virgins. Virginity, by being once lost, may be ten times\\r\\nfound; by being ever kept, it is ever lost. ’Tis too cold a companion.\\r\\nAway with it!\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nI will stand for’t a little, though therefore I die a virgin.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nThere’s little can be said in’t; ’tis against the rule of nature. To\\r\\nspeak on the part of virginity is to accuse your mothers; which is most\\r\\ninfallible disobedience. He that hangs himself is a virgin: virginity\\r\\nmurders itself, and should be buried in highways out of all sanctified\\r\\nlimit, as a desperate offendress against nature. Virginity breeds\\r\\nmites, much like a cheese; consumes itself to the very paring, and so\\r\\ndies with feeding his own stomach. Besides, virginity is peevish,\\r\\nproud, idle, made of self-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the\\r\\ncanon. Keep it not; you cannot choose but lose by’t. Out with’t! Within\\r\\nthe year it will make itself two, which is a goodly increase, and the\\r\\nprincipal itself not much the worse. Away with it!\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nHow might one do, sir, to lose it to her own liking?\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nLet me see. Marry, ill, to like him that ne’er it likes. ’Tis a\\r\\ncommodity will lose the gloss with lying; the longer kept, the less\\r\\nworth. Off with’t while ’tis vendible; answer the time of request.\\r\\nVirginity, like an old courtier, wears her cap out of fashion, richly\\r\\nsuited, but unsuitable, just like the brooch and the toothpick, which\\r\\nwear not now. Your date is better in your pie and your porridge than in\\r\\nyour cheek. And your virginity, your old virginity, is like one of our\\r\\nFrench wither’d pears; it looks ill, it eats drily; marry, ’tis a\\r\\nwither’d pear; it was formerly better; marry, yet ’tis a wither’d pear.\\r\\nWill you anything with it?\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nNot my virginity yet.\\r\\nThere shall your master have a thousand loves,\\r\\nA mother, and a mistress, and a friend,\\r\\nA phoenix, captain, and an enemy,\\r\\nA guide, a goddess, and a sovereign,\\r\\nA counsellor, a traitress, and a dear:\\r\\nHis humble ambition, proud humility,\\r\\nHis jarring concord, and his discord dulcet,\\r\\nHis faith, his sweet disaster; with a world\\r\\nOf pretty, fond, adoptious christendoms\\r\\nThat blinking Cupid gossips. Now shall he—\\r\\nI know not what he shall. God send him well!\\r\\nThe court’s a learning-place; and he is one.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nWhat one, i’ faith?\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nThat I wish well. ’Tis pity—\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nWhat’s pity?\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nThat wishing well had not a body in’t\\r\\nWhich might be felt, that we, the poorer born,\\r\\nWhose baser stars do shut us up in wishes,\\r\\nMight with effects of them follow our friends,\\r\\nAnd show what we alone must think, which never\\r\\nReturns us thanks.\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter a Page.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAGE.\\r\\nMonsieur Parolles, my lord calls for you.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exit Page._]\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nLittle Helen, farewell. If I can remember thee, I will think of thee at\\r\\ncourt.\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nMonsieur Parolles, you were born under a charitable star.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nUnder Mars, I.\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nI especially think, under Mars.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nWhy under Mars?\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nThe wars hath so kept you under, that you must needs be born under\\r\\nMars.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nWhen he was predominant.\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nWhen he was retrograde, I think rather.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nWhy think you so?\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nYou go so much backward when you fight.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nThat’s for advantage.\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nSo is running away, when fear proposes the safety: but the composition\\r\\nthat your valour and fear makes in you is a virtue of a good wing, and\\r\\nI like the wear well.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nI am so full of business I cannot answer thee acutely. I will return\\r\\nperfect courtier; in the which my instruction shall serve to naturalize\\r\\nthee, so thou wilt be capable of a courtier’s counsel, and understand\\r\\nwhat advice shall thrust upon thee; else thou diest in thine\\r\\nunthankfulness, and thine ignorance makes thee away. Farewell. When\\r\\nthou hast leisure, say thy prayers; when thou hast none, remember thy\\r\\nfriends. Get thee a good husband, and use him as he uses thee. So,\\r\\nfarewell.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exit._]\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nOur remedies oft in ourselves do lie,\\r\\nWhich we ascribe to heaven: the fated sky\\r\\nGives us free scope; only doth backward pull\\r\\nOur slow designs when we ourselves are dull.\\r\\nWhat power is it which mounts my love so high,\\r\\nThat makes me see, and cannot feed mine eye?\\r\\nThe mightiest space in fortune nature brings\\r\\nTo join like likes, and kiss like native things.\\r\\nImpossible be strange attempts to those\\r\\nThat weigh their pains in sense, and do suppose\\r\\nWhat hath been cannot be. Who ever strove\\r\\nTo show her merit that did miss her love?\\r\\nThe king’s disease,—my project may deceive me,\\r\\nBut my intents are fix’d, and will not leave me.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exit._]\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE II. Paris. A room in the King’s palace.\\r\\n\\r\\n Flourish of cornets. Enter the King of France, with letters; Lords and\\r\\n others attending.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nThe Florentines and Senoys are by th’ ears;\\r\\nHave fought with equal fortune, and continue\\r\\nA braving war.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST LORD.\\r\\nSo ’tis reported, sir.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nNay, ’tis most credible, we here receive it,\\r\\nA certainty, vouch’d from our cousin Austria,\\r\\nWith caution, that the Florentine will move us\\r\\nFor speedy aid; wherein our dearest friend\\r\\nPrejudicates the business, and would seem\\r\\nTo have us make denial.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST LORD.\\r\\nHis love and wisdom,\\r\\nApprov’d so to your majesty, may plead\\r\\nFor amplest credence.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nHe hath arm’d our answer,\\r\\nAnd Florence is denied before he comes:\\r\\nYet, for our gentlemen that mean to see\\r\\nThe Tuscan service, freely have they leave\\r\\nTo stand on either part.\\r\\n\\r\\nSECOND LORD.\\r\\nIt well may serve\\r\\nA nursery to our gentry, who are sick\\r\\nFor breathing and exploit.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nWhat’s he comes here?\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Bertram, Lafew and Parolles.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST LORD.\\r\\nIt is the Count Rossillon, my good lord,\\r\\nYoung Bertram.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nYouth, thou bear’st thy father’s face;\\r\\nFrank nature, rather curious than in haste,\\r\\nHath well compos’d thee. Thy father’s moral parts\\r\\nMayst thou inherit too! Welcome to Paris.\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nMy thanks and duty are your majesty’s.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nI would I had that corporal soundness now,\\r\\nAs when thy father and myself in friendship\\r\\nFirst tried our soldiership. He did look far\\r\\nInto the service of the time, and was\\r\\nDiscipled of the bravest. He lasted long,\\r\\nBut on us both did haggish age steal on,\\r\\nAnd wore us out of act. It much repairs me\\r\\nTo talk of your good father; in his youth\\r\\nHe had the wit which I can well observe\\r\\nToday in our young lords; but they may jest\\r\\nTill their own scorn return to them unnoted\\r\\nEre they can hide their levity in honour\\r\\nSo like a courtier, contempt nor bitterness\\r\\nWere in his pride or sharpness; if they were,\\r\\nHis equal had awak’d them, and his honour,\\r\\nClock to itself, knew the true minute when\\r\\nException bid him speak, and at this time\\r\\nHis tongue obey’d his hand. Who were below him\\r\\nHe us’d as creatures of another place,\\r\\nAnd bow’d his eminent top to their low ranks,\\r\\nMaking them proud of his humility,\\r\\nIn their poor praise he humbled. Such a man\\r\\nMight be a copy to these younger times;\\r\\nWhich, followed well, would demonstrate them now\\r\\nBut goers backward.\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nHis good remembrance, sir,\\r\\nLies richer in your thoughts than on his tomb;\\r\\nSo in approof lives not his epitaph\\r\\nAs in your royal speech.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nWould I were with him! He would always say,—\\r\\nMethinks I hear him now; his plausive words\\r\\nHe scatter’d not in ears, but grafted them\\r\\nTo grow there and to bear,—“Let me not live,”\\r\\nThis his good melancholy oft began\\r\\nOn the catastrophe and heel of pastime,\\r\\nWhen it was out,—“Let me not live” quoth he,\\r\\n“After my flame lacks oil, to be the snuff\\r\\nOf younger spirits, whose apprehensive senses\\r\\nAll but new things disdain; whose judgments are\\r\\nMere fathers of their garments; whose constancies\\r\\nExpire before their fashions.” This he wish’d.\\r\\nI, after him, do after him wish too,\\r\\nSince I nor wax nor honey can bring home,\\r\\nI quickly were dissolved from my hive\\r\\nTo give some labourers room.\\r\\n\\r\\nSECOND LORD.\\r\\nYou’re lov’d, sir;\\r\\nThey that least lend it you shall lack you first.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nI fill a place, I know’t. How long is’t, Count,\\r\\nSince the physician at your father’s died?\\r\\nHe was much fam’d.\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nSome six months since, my lord.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nIf he were living, I would try him yet;—\\r\\nLend me an arm;—the rest have worn me out\\r\\nWith several applications; nature and sickness\\r\\nDebate it at their leisure. Welcome, Count;\\r\\nMy son’s no dearer.\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nThank your majesty.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exeunt. Flourish._]\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE III. Rossillon. A Room in the Palace.\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Countess, Steward and Clown.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nI will now hear. What say you of this gentlewoman?\\r\\n\\r\\nSTEWARD.\\r\\nMadam, the care I have had to even your content, I wish might be found\\r\\nin the calendar of my past endeavours; for then we wound our modesty,\\r\\nand make foul the clearness of our deservings, when of ourselves we\\r\\npublish them.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nWhat does this knave here? Get you gone, sirrah. The complaints I have\\r\\nheard of you I do not all believe; ’tis my slowness that I do not; for\\r\\nI know you lack not folly to commit them, and have ability enough to\\r\\nmake such knaveries yours.\\r\\n\\r\\nCLOWN.\\r\\n’Tis not unknown to you, madam, I am a poor fellow.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nWell, sir.\\r\\n\\r\\nCLOWN.\\r\\nNo, madam, ’tis not so well that I am poor, though many of the rich are\\r\\ndamned; but if I may have your ladyship’s good will to go to the world,\\r\\nIsbel the woman and I will do as we may.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nWilt thou needs be a beggar?\\r\\n\\r\\nCLOWN.\\r\\nI do beg your good will in this case.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nIn what case?\\r\\n\\r\\nCLOWN.\\r\\nIn Isbel’s case and mine own. Service is no heritage, and I think I\\r\\nshall never have the blessing of God till I have issue of my body; for\\r\\nthey say barnes are blessings.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nTell me thy reason why thou wilt marry.\\r\\n\\r\\nCLOWN.\\r\\nMy poor body, madam, requires it; I am driven on by the flesh, and he\\r\\nmust needs go that the devil drives.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nIs this all your worship’s reason?\\r\\n\\r\\nCLOWN.\\r\\nFaith, madam, I have other holy reasons, such as they are.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nMay the world know them?\\r\\n\\r\\nCLOWN.\\r\\nI have been, madam, a wicked creature, as you and all flesh and blood\\r\\nare; and indeed I do marry that I may repent.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nThy marriage, sooner than thy wickedness.\\r\\n\\r\\nCLOWN.\\r\\nI am out of friends, madam, and I hope to have friends for my wife’s\\r\\nsake.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nSuch friends are thine enemies, knave.\\r\\n\\r\\nCLOWN.\\r\\nY’are shallow, madam, in great friends; for the knaves come to do that\\r\\nfor me which I am a-weary of. He that ears my land spares my team, and\\r\\ngives me leave to in the crop: if I be his cuckold, he’s my drudge. He\\r\\nthat comforts my wife is the cherisher of my flesh and blood; he that\\r\\ncherishes my flesh and blood loves my flesh and blood; he that loves my\\r\\nflesh and blood is my friend; ergo, he that kisses my wife is my\\r\\nfriend. If men could be contented to be what they are, there were no\\r\\nfear in marriage; for young Charbon the puritan and old Poysam the\\r\\npapist, howsome’er their hearts are sever’d in religion, their heads\\r\\nare both one; they may jowl horns together like any deer i’ the herd.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nWilt thou ever be a foul-mouth’d and calumnious knave?\\r\\n\\r\\nCLOWN.\\r\\nA prophet I, madam; and I speak the truth the next way:\\r\\n   _For I the ballad will repeat,\\r\\n   Which men full true shall find;\\r\\n   Your marriage comes by destiny,\\r\\n   Your cuckoo sings by kind._\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nGet you gone, sir; I’ll talk with you more anon.\\r\\n\\r\\nSTEWARD.\\r\\nMay it please you, madam, that he bid Helen come to you; of her I am to\\r\\nspeak.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nSirrah, tell my gentlewoman I would speak with her; Helen I mean.\\r\\n\\r\\nCLOWN.\\r\\n[_Sings._]\\r\\n_   Was this fair face the cause, quoth she,\\r\\n     Why the Grecians sacked Troy?\\r\\n   Fond done, done fond,\\r\\n      Was this King Priam’s joy?\\r\\n   With that she sighed as she stood,\\r\\n   With that she sighed as she stood,\\r\\n      And gave this sentence then:\\r\\n   Among nine bad if one be good,\\r\\n   Among nine bad if one be good,\\r\\n     There’s yet one good in ten._\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nWhat, one good in ten? You corrupt the song, sirrah.\\r\\n\\r\\nCLOWN.\\r\\nOne good woman in ten, madam, which is a purifying o’ the song. Would\\r\\nGod would serve the world so all the year! We’d find no fault with the\\r\\ntithe-woman, if I were the parson. One in ten, quoth ’a! And we might\\r\\nhave a good woman born but or every blazing star, or at an earthquake,\\r\\n’twould mend the lottery well; a man may draw his heart out ere he\\r\\npluck one.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nYou’ll be gone, sir knave, and do as I command you!\\r\\n\\r\\nCLOWN.\\r\\nThat man should be at woman’s command, and yet no hurt done! Though\\r\\nhonesty be no puritan, yet it will do no hurt; it will wear the\\r\\nsurplice of humility over the black gown of a big heart. I am going,\\r\\nforsooth; the business is for Helen to come hither.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exit._]\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nWell, now.\\r\\n\\r\\nSTEWARD.\\r\\nI know, madam, you love your gentlewoman entirely.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nFaith I do. Her father bequeath’d her to me, and she herself, without\\r\\nother advantage, may lawfully make title to as much love as she finds;\\r\\nthere is more owing her than is paid, and more shall be paid her than\\r\\nshe’ll demand.\\r\\n\\r\\nSTEWARD.\\r\\nMadam, I was very late more near her than I think she wish’d me; alone\\r\\nshe was, and did communicate to herself her own words to her own ears;\\r\\nshe thought, I dare vow for her, they touch’d not any stranger sense.\\r\\nHer matter was, she loved your son. Fortune, she said, was no goddess,\\r\\nthat had put such difference betwixt their two estates; Love no god,\\r\\nthat would not extend his might only where qualities were level; Diana\\r\\nno queen of virgins, that would suffer her poor knight surpris’d,\\r\\nwithout rescue in the first assault or ransom afterward. This she\\r\\ndeliver’d in the most bitter touch of sorrow that e’er I heard virgin\\r\\nexclaim in, which I held my duty speedily to acquaint you withal;\\r\\nsithence, in the loss that may happen, it concerns you something to\\r\\nknow it.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nYou have discharg’d this honestly; keep it to yourself; many\\r\\nlikelihoods inform’d me of this before, which hung so tottering in the\\r\\nbalance that I could neither believe nor misdoubt. Pray you leave me;\\r\\nstall this in your bosom; and I thank you for your honest care. I will\\r\\nspeak with you further anon.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exit Steward._]\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Helena.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven so it was with me when I was young;\\r\\nIf ever we are nature’s, these are ours; this thorn\\r\\nDoth to our rose of youth rightly belong;\\r\\nOur blood to us, this to our blood is born;\\r\\nIt is the show and seal of nature’s truth,\\r\\nWhere love’s strong passion is impress’d in youth.\\r\\nBy our remembrances of days foregone,\\r\\nSuch were our faults, or then we thought them none.\\r\\nHer eye is sick on’t; I observe her now.\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nWhat is your pleasure, madam?\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nYou know, Helen,\\r\\nI am a mother to you.\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nMine honourable mistress.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nNay, a mother.\\r\\nWhy not a mother? When I said a mother,\\r\\nMethought you saw a serpent. What’s in mother,\\r\\nThat you start at it? I say I am your mother,\\r\\nAnd put you in the catalogue of those\\r\\nThat were enwombed mine. ’Tis often seen\\r\\nAdoption strives with nature, and choice breeds\\r\\nA native slip to us from foreign seeds.\\r\\nYou ne’er oppress’d me with a mother’s groan,\\r\\nYet I express to you a mother’s care.\\r\\nGod’s mercy, maiden! does it curd thy blood\\r\\nTo say I am thy mother? What’s the matter,\\r\\nThat this distempered messenger of wet,\\r\\nThe many-colour’d Iris, rounds thine eye?\\r\\n—Why, that you are my daughter?\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nThat I am not.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nI say, I am your mother.\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nPardon, madam;\\r\\nThe Count Rossillon cannot be my brother.\\r\\nI am from humble, he from honoured name;\\r\\nNo note upon my parents, his all noble,\\r\\nMy master, my dear lord he is; and I\\r\\nHis servant live, and will his vassal die.\\r\\nHe must not be my brother.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nNor I your mother?\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nYou are my mother, madam; would you were—\\r\\nSo that my lord your son were not my brother,—\\r\\nIndeed my mother! or were you both our mothers,\\r\\nI care no more for than I do for heaven,\\r\\nSo I were not his sister. Can’t no other,\\r\\nBut, I your daughter, he must be my brother?\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nYes, Helen, you might be my daughter-in-law.\\r\\nGod shield you mean it not! daughter and mother\\r\\nSo strive upon your pulse. What! pale again?\\r\\nMy fear hath catch’d your fondness; now I see\\r\\nThe mystery of your loneliness, and find\\r\\nYour salt tears’ head. Now to all sense ’tis gross\\r\\nYou love my son; invention is asham’d,\\r\\nAgainst the proclamation of thy passion\\r\\nTo say thou dost not. Therefore tell me true;\\r\\nBut tell me then, ’tis so; for, look, thy cheeks\\r\\nConfess it, t’one to th’other; and thine eyes\\r\\nSee it so grossly shown in thy behaviours,\\r\\nThat in their kind they speak it; only sin\\r\\nAnd hellish obstinacy tie thy tongue,\\r\\nThat truth should be suspected. Speak, is’t so?\\r\\nIf it be so, you have wound a goodly clew;\\r\\nIf it be not, forswear’t: howe’er, I charge thee,\\r\\nAs heaven shall work in me for thine avail,\\r\\nTo tell me truly.\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nGood madam, pardon me.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nDo you love my son?\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nYour pardon, noble mistress.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nLove you my son?\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nDo not you love him, madam?\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nGo not about; my love hath in’t a bond\\r\\nWhereof the world takes note. Come, come, disclose\\r\\nThe state of your affection, for your passions\\r\\nHave to the full appeach’d.\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nThen I confess,\\r\\nHere on my knee, before high heaven and you,\\r\\nThat before you, and next unto high heaven,\\r\\nI love your son.\\r\\nMy friends were poor, but honest; so’s my love.\\r\\nBe not offended; for it hurts not him\\r\\nThat he is lov’d of me; I follow him not\\r\\nBy any token of presumptuous suit,\\r\\nNor would I have him till I do deserve him;\\r\\nYet never know how that desert should be.\\r\\nI know I love in vain, strive against hope;\\r\\nYet in this captious and inteemable sieve\\r\\nI still pour in the waters of my love\\r\\nAnd lack not to lose still. Thus, Indian-like,\\r\\nReligious in mine error, I adore\\r\\nThe sun that looks upon his worshipper,\\r\\nBut knows of him no more. My dearest madam,\\r\\nLet not your hate encounter with my love,\\r\\nFor loving where you do; but if yourself,\\r\\nWhose aged honour cites a virtuous youth,\\r\\nDid ever, in so true a flame of liking,\\r\\nWish chastely, and love dearly, that your Dian\\r\\nWas both herself and love; O then, give pity\\r\\nTo her whose state is such that cannot choose\\r\\nBut lend and give where she is sure to lose;\\r\\nThat seeks not to find that her search implies,\\r\\nBut riddle-like, lives sweetly where she dies!\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nHad you not lately an intent,—speak truly,—\\r\\nTo go to Paris?\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nMadam, I had.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nWherefore? tell true.\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nI will tell truth; by grace itself I swear.\\r\\nYou know my father left me some prescriptions\\r\\nOf rare and prov’d effects, such as his reading\\r\\nAnd manifest experience had collected\\r\\nFor general sovereignty; and that he will’d me\\r\\nIn heedfull’st reservation to bestow them,\\r\\nAs notes whose faculties inclusive were\\r\\nMore than they were in note. Amongst the rest\\r\\nThere is a remedy, approv’d, set down,\\r\\nTo cure the desperate languishings whereof\\r\\nThe king is render’d lost.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nThis was your motive\\r\\nFor Paris, was it? Speak.\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nMy lord your son made me to think of this;\\r\\nElse Paris, and the medicine, and the king,\\r\\nHad from the conversation of my thoughts\\r\\nHaply been absent then.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nBut think you, Helen,\\r\\nIf you should tender your supposed aid,\\r\\nHe would receive it?

Farewell, young lords.\\r\\nWhether I live or die, be you the sons\\r\\nOf worthy Frenchmen; let higher Italy,—\\r\\nThose bated that inherit but the fall\\r\\nOf the last monarchy—see that you come\\r\\nNot to woo honour, but to wed it, when\\r\\nThe bravest questant shrinks: find what you seek,\\r\\nThat fame may cry you loud. I say farewell.\\r\\n\\r\\nSECOND LORD.\\r\\nHealth, at your bidding serve your majesty!\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nThose girls of Italy, take heed of them;\\r\\nThey say our French lack language to deny\\r\\nIf they demand; beware of being captives\\r\\nBefore you serve.\\r\\n\\r\\nBOTH.\\r\\nOur hearts receive your warnings.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nFarewell.—Come hither to me.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_The King retires to a couch._]\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST LORD.\\r\\nO my sweet lord, that you will stay behind us!\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\n’Tis not his fault; the spark.\\r\\n\\r\\nSECOND LORD.\\r\\nO, ’tis brave wars!\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nMost admirable! I have seen those wars.\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nI am commanded here, and kept a coil with,\\r\\n“Too young”, and “the next year” and “’tis too early”.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nAn thy mind stand to’t, boy, steal away bravely.\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nI shall stay here the forehorse to a smock,\\r\\nCreaking my shoes on the plain masonry,\\r\\nTill honour be bought up, and no sword worn\\r\\nBut one to dance with.

Good sparks and lustrous, a\\r\\nword, good metals. You shall find in the regiment of the Spinii one\\r\\nCaptain Spurio, with his cicatrice, an emblem of war, here on his\\r\\nsinister cheek; it was this very sword entrench’d it. Say to him I\\r\\nlive; and observe his reports for me.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST LORD.\\r\\nWe shall, noble captain.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nMars dote on you for his novices!\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exeunt Lords._]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat will ye do?\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nStay the king.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nUse a more spacious ceremony to the noble lords; you have restrain’d\\r\\nyourself within the list of too cold an adieu.

After them, and take a more dilated farewell.\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nAnd I will do so.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nWorthy fellows, and like to prove most sinewy sword-men.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exeunt Bertram and Parolles._]\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Lafew.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nPardon, my lord [_kneeling_], for me and for my tidings.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nI’ll fee thee to stand up.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nThen here’s a man stands that has brought his pardon.\\r\\nI would you had kneel’d, my lord, to ask me mercy,\\r\\nAnd that at my bidding you could so stand up.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nI would I had; so I had broke thy pate,\\r\\nAnd ask’d thee mercy for’t.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nGood faith, across;\\r\\nBut, my good lord, ’tis thus: will you be cur’d\\r\\nOf your infirmity?\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nNo.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nO, will you eat\\r\\nNo grapes, my royal fox? Yes, but you will\\r\\nMy noble grapes, and if my royal fox\\r\\nCould reach them. I have seen a medicine\\r\\nThat’s able to breathe life into a stone,\\r\\nQuicken a rock, and make you dance canary\\r\\nWith sprightly fire and motion; whose simple touch\\r\\nIs powerful to araise King Pippen, nay,\\r\\nTo give great Charlemain a pen in’s hand\\r\\nAnd write to her a love-line.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nWhat ‘her’ is this?\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nWhy, doctor ‘she’! My lord, there’s one arriv’d,\\r\\nIf you will see her. Now, by my faith and honour,\\r\\nIf seriously I may convey my thoughts\\r\\nIn this my light deliverance, I have spoke\\r\\nWith one that in her sex, her years, profession,\\r\\nWisdom, and constancy, hath amaz’d me more\\r\\nThan I dare blame my weakness. Will you see her,\\r\\nFor that is her demand, and know her business?\\r\\nThat done, laugh well at me.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nNow, good Lafew,\\r\\nBring in the admiration; that we with thee\\r\\nMay spend our wonder too, or take off thine\\r\\nBy wond’ring how thou took’st it.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nNay, I’ll fit you,\\r\\nAnd not be all day neither.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exit Lafew._]\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nThus he his special nothing ever prologues.\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Lafew with Helena.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nNay, come your ways.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nThis haste hath wings indeed.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nNay, come your ways.\\r\\nThis is his majesty, say your mind to him.\\r\\nA traitor you do look like, but such traitors\\r\\nHis majesty seldom fears; I am Cressid’s uncle,\\r\\nThat dare leave two together.

On his bed of death\\r\\nMany receipts he gave me; chiefly one,\\r\\nWhich, as the dearest issue of his practice,\\r\\nAnd of his old experience the only darling,\\r\\nHe bade me store up as a triple eye,\\r\\nSafer than mine own two; more dear I have so,\\r\\nAnd hearing your high majesty is touch’d\\r\\nWith that malignant cause, wherein the honour\\r\\nOf my dear father’s gift stands chief in power,\\r\\nI come to tender it, and my appliance,\\r\\nWith all bound humbleness.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nWe thank you, maiden,\\r\\nBut may not be so credulous of cure,\\r\\nWhen our most learned doctors leave us, and\\r\\nThe congregated college have concluded\\r\\nThat labouring art can never ransom nature\\r\\nFrom her inaidable estate. I say we must not\\r\\nSo stain our judgment, or corrupt our hope,\\r\\nTo prostitute our past-cure malady\\r\\nTo empirics, or to dissever so\\r\\nOur great self and our credit, to esteem\\r\\nA senseless help, when help past sense we deem.\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nMy duty then shall pay me for my pains.\\r\\nI will no more enforce mine office on you,\\r\\nHumbly entreating from your royal thoughts\\r\\nA modest one to bear me back again.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nI cannot give thee less, to be call’d grateful.\\r\\nThou thought’st to help me; and such thanks I give\\r\\nAs one near death to those that wish him live.\\r\\nBut what at full I know, thou know’st no part;\\r\\nI knowing all my peril, thou no art.\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nWhat I can do can do no hurt to try,\\r\\nSince you set up your rest ’gainst remedy.\\r\\nHe that of greatest works is finisher\\r\\nOft does them by the weakest minister.\\r\\nSo holy writ in babes hath judgment shown,\\r\\nWhen judges have been babes.

Fare thee well, kind maid.\\r\\nThy pains, not us’d, must by thyself be paid;\\r\\nProffers, not took, reap thanks for their reward.\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nInspired merit so by breath is barr’d.\\r\\nIt is not so with Him that all things knows\\r\\nAs ’tis with us that square our guess by shows;\\r\\nBut most it is presumption in us when\\r\\nThe help of heaven we count the act of men.\\r\\nDear sir, to my endeavours give consent;\\r\\nOf heaven, not me, make an experiment.\\r\\nI am not an impostor, that proclaim\\r\\nMyself against the level of mine aim,\\r\\nBut know I think, and think I know most sure,\\r\\nMy art is not past power nor you past cure.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nArt thou so confident? Within what space\\r\\nHop’st thou my cure?\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nThe greatest grace lending grace.\\r\\nEre twice the horses of the sun shall bring\\r\\nTheir fiery torcher his diurnal ring,\\r\\nEre twice in murk and occidental damp\\r\\nMoist Hesperus hath quench’d her sleepy lamp;\\r\\nOr four and twenty times the pilot’s glass\\r\\nHath told the thievish minutes how they pass;\\r\\nWhat is infirm from your sound parts shall fly,\\r\\nHealth shall live free, and sickness freely die.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nUpon thy certainty and confidence\\r\\nWhat dar’st thou venture?\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nTax of impudence,\\r\\nA strumpet’s boldness, a divulged shame,\\r\\nTraduc’d by odious ballads; my maiden’s name\\r\\nSear’d otherwise; ne worse of worst extended\\r\\nWith vildest torture, let my life be ended.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nMethinks in thee some blessed spirit doth speak\\r\\nHis powerful sound within an organ weak;\\r\\nAnd what impossibility would slay\\r\\nIn common sense, sense saves another way.\\r\\nThy life is dear, for all that life can rate\\r\\nWorth name of life in thee hath estimate:\\r\\nYouth, beauty, wisdom, courage, all\\r\\nThat happiness and prime can happy call.\\r\\nThou this to hazard needs must intimate\\r\\nSkill infinite, or monstrous desperate.\\r\\nSweet practiser, thy physic I will try,\\r\\nThat ministers thine own death if I die.\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nIf I break time, or flinch in property\\r\\nOf what I spoke, unpitied let me die,\\r\\nAnd well deserv’d. Not helping, death’s my fee;\\r\\nBut if I help, what do you promise me?\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nMake thy demand.\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nBut will you make it even?\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nAy, by my sceptre and my hopes of heaven.\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nThen shalt thou give me, with thy kingly hand\\r\\nWhat husband in thy power I will command:\\r\\nExempted be from me the arrogance\\r\\nTo choose from forth the royal blood of France,\\r\\nMy low and humble name to propagate\\r\\nWith any branch or image of thy state;\\r\\nBut such a one, thy vassal, whom I know\\r\\nIs free for me to ask, thee to bestow.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nHere is my hand; the premises observ’d,\\r\\nThy will by my performance shall be serv’d;\\r\\nSo make the choice of thy own time, for I,\\r\\nThy resolv’d patient, on thee still rely.\\r\\nMore should I question thee, and more I must,\\r\\nThough more to know could not be more to trust:\\r\\nFrom whence thou cam’st, how tended on; but rest\\r\\nUnquestion’d welcome, and undoubted bless’d.\\r\\nGive me some help here, ho! If thou proceed\\r\\nAs high as word, my deed shall match thy deed.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Flourish. Exeunt._]\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE II. Rossillon.

I know my business is\\r\\nbut to the court.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nTo the court! Why, what place make you special, when you put off that\\r\\nwith such contempt? But to the court!\\r\\n\\r\\nCLOWN.\\r\\nTruly, madam, if God have lent a man any manners, he may easily put it\\r\\noff at court: he that cannot make a leg, put off’s cap, kiss his hand,\\r\\nand say nothing, has neither leg, hands, lip, nor cap; and indeed such\\r\\na fellow, to say precisely, were not for the court; but for me, I have\\r\\nan answer will serve all men.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nMarry, that’s a bountiful answer that fits all questions.\\r\\n\\r\\nCLOWN.\\r\\nIt is like a barber’s chair, that fits all buttocks—the pin-buttock,\\r\\nthe quatch-buttock, the brawn-buttock, or any buttock.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nWill your answer serve fit to all questions?\\r\\n\\r\\nCLOWN.\\r\\nAs fit as ten groats is for the hand of an attorney, as your French\\r\\ncrown for your taffety punk, as Tib’s rush for Tom’s forefinger, as a\\r\\npancake for Shrove-Tuesday, a morris for May-day, as the nail to his\\r\\nhole, the cuckold to his horn, as a scolding quean to a wrangling\\r\\nknave, as the nun’s lip to the friar’s mouth; nay, as the pudding to\\r\\nhis skin.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nHave you, I say, an answer of such fitness for all questions?\\r\\n\\r\\nCLOWN.\\r\\nFrom below your duke to beneath your constable, it will fit any\\r\\nquestion.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nIt must be an answer of most monstrous size that must fit all demands.\\r\\n\\r\\nCLOWN.\\r\\nBut a trifle neither, in good faith, if the learned should speak truth\\r\\nof it. Here it is, and all that belongs to’t. Ask me if I am a\\r\\ncourtier; it shall do you no harm to learn.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nTo be young again, if we could: I will be a fool in question, hoping to\\r\\nbe the wiser by your answer. I pray you, sir, are you a courtier?\\r\\n\\r\\nCLOWN.\\r\\nO Lord, sir! There’s a simple putting off. More, more, a hundred of\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nSir, I am a poor friend of yours, that loves you.\\r\\n\\r\\nCLOWN.\\r\\nO Lord, sir! Thick, thick; spare not me.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nI think, sir, you can eat none of this homely meat.\\r\\n\\r\\nCLOWN.\\r\\nO Lord, sir! Nay, put me to’t, I warrant you.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nYou were lately whipp’d, sir, as I think.\\r\\n\\r\\nCLOWN.\\r\\nO Lord, sir! Spare not me.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nDo you cry ‘O Lord, sir!’ at your whipping, and ‘spare not me’? Indeed\\r\\nyour ‘O Lord, sir!’ is very sequent to your whipping. You would answer\\r\\nvery well to a whipping, if you were but bound to’t.\\r\\n\\r\\nCLOWN.\\r\\nI ne’er had worse luck in my life in my ‘O Lord, sir!’ I see things may\\r\\nserve long, but not serve ever.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nI play the noble housewife with the time, to entertain it so merrily\\r\\nwith a fool.\\r\\n\\r\\nCLOWN.\\r\\nO Lord, sir! Why, there’t serves well again.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nAn end, sir! To your business. Give Helen this,\\r\\nAnd urge her to a present answer back.\\r\\nCommend me to my kinsmen and my son.\\r\\nThis is not much.\\r\\n\\r\\nCLOWN.\\r\\nNot much commendation to them?\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nNot much employment for you.

The King’s palace.\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Bertram, Lafew and Parolles.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nThey say miracles are past; and we have our philosophical persons to\\r\\nmake modern and familiar things supernatural and causeless. Hence is it\\r\\nthat we make trifles of terrors, ensconcing ourselves into seeming\\r\\nknowledge when we should submit ourselves to an unknown fear.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nWhy, ’tis the rarest argument of wonder that hath shot out in our\\r\\nlatter times.\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nAnd so ’tis.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nTo be relinquish’d of the artists,—\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nSo I say; both of Galen and Paracelsus.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nOf all the learned and authentic fellows,—\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nRight; so I say.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nThat gave him out incurable,—\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nWhy, there ’tis; so say I too.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nNot to be helped.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nRight; as ’twere a man assur’d of a—\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nUncertain life and sure death.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nJust; you say well. So would I have said.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nI may truly say, it is a novelty to the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nIt is indeed; if you will have it in showing, you shall read it in what\\r\\ndo you call there?\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nA showing of a heavenly effect in an earthly actor.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nThat’s it; I would have said the very same.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nWhy, your dolphin is not lustier; fore me, I speak in respect—\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nNay, ’tis strange, ’tis very strange; that is the brief and the tedious\\r\\nof it; and he’s of a most facinerious spirit that will not acknowledge\\r\\nit to be the—\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nVery hand of heaven.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nAy, so I say.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nIn a most weak—\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nAnd debile minister, great power, great transcendence, which should\\r\\nindeed give us a further use to be made than alone the recov’ry of the\\r\\nking, as to be—\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nGenerally thankful.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nI would have said it; you say well.

I am sure thy father drank wine.

This is the man.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nWhy, then, young Bertram, take her; she’s thy wife.\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nMy wife, my liege! I shall beseech your highness,\\r\\nIn such a business give me leave to use\\r\\nThe help of mine own eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nKnow’st thou not, Bertram,\\r\\nWhat she has done for me?\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nYes, my good lord,\\r\\nBut never hope to know why I should marry her.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nThou know’st she has rais’d me from my sickly bed.\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nBut follows it, my lord, to bring me down\\r\\nMust answer for your raising? I know her well;\\r\\nShe had her breeding at my father’s charge:\\r\\nA poor physician’s daughter my wife! Disdain\\r\\nRather corrupt me ever!\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\n’Tis only title thou disdain’st in her, the which\\r\\nI can build up. Strange is it that our bloods,\\r\\nOf colour, weight, and heat, pour’d all together,\\r\\nWould quite confound distinction, yet stands off\\r\\nIn differences so mighty. If she be\\r\\nAll that is virtuous, save what thou dislik’st,\\r\\nA poor physician’s daughter,—thou dislik’st—\\r\\nOf virtue for the name. But do not so.\\r\\nFrom lowest place when virtuous things proceed,\\r\\nThe place is dignified by the doer’s deed.\\r\\nWhere great additions swell’s, and virtue none,\\r\\nIt is a dropsied honour. Good alone\\r\\nIs good without a name; vileness is so:\\r\\nThe property by what it is should go,\\r\\nNot by the title. She is young, wise, fair;\\r\\nIn these to nature she’s immediate heir;\\r\\nAnd these breed honour: that is honour’s scorn\\r\\nWhich challenges itself as honour’s born,\\r\\nAnd is not like the sire. Honours thrive\\r\\nWhen rather from our acts we them derive\\r\\nThan our fore-goers. The mere word’s a slave,\\r\\nDebauch’d on every tomb, on every grave\\r\\nA lying trophy, and as oft is dumb\\r\\nWhere dust and damn’d oblivion is the tomb\\r\\nOf honour’d bones indeed. What should be said?\\r\\nIf thou canst like this creature as a maid,\\r\\nI can create the rest.

Here, take her hand,\\r\\nProud scornful boy, unworthy this good gift,\\r\\nThat dost in vile misprision shackle up\\r\\nMy love and her desert; that canst not dream\\r\\nWe, poising us in her defective scale,\\r\\nShall weigh thee to the beam; that wilt not know\\r\\nIt is in us to plant thine honour where\\r\\nWe please to have it grow. Check thy contempt;\\r\\nObey our will, which travails in thy good;\\r\\nBelieve not thy disdain, but presently\\r\\nDo thine own fortunes that obedient right\\r\\nWhich both thy duty owes and our power claims;\\r\\nOr I will throw thee from my care for ever\\r\\nInto the staggers and the careless lapse\\r\\nOf youth and ignorance; both my revenge and hate\\r\\nLoosing upon thee in the name of justice,\\r\\nWithout all terms of pity. Speak! Thine answer!\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nPardon, my gracious lord; for I submit\\r\\nMy fancy to your eyes. When I consider\\r\\nWhat great creation, and what dole of honour\\r\\nFlies where you bid it, I find that she, which late\\r\\nWas in my nobler thoughts most base, is now\\r\\nThe praised of the king; who, so ennobled,\\r\\nIs as ’twere born so.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nTake her by the hand,\\r\\nAnd tell her she is thine; to whom I promise\\r\\nA counterpoise; if not to thy estate,\\r\\nA balance more replete.\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nI take her hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nGood fortune and the favour of the king\\r\\nSmile upon this contract; whose ceremony\\r\\nShall seem expedient on the now-born brief,\\r\\nAnd be perform’d tonight. The solemn feast\\r\\nShall more attend upon the coming space,\\r\\nExpecting absent friends. As thou lov’st her,\\r\\nThy love’s to me religious; else, does err.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exeunt King, Bertram, Helena, Lords, and Attendants._]\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nDo you hear, monsieur?

Yet the scarfs\\r\\nand the bannerets about thee did manifoldly dissuade me from believing\\r\\nthee a vessel of too great a burden. I have now found thee; when I lose\\r\\nthee again I care not. Yet art thou good for nothing but taking up, and\\r\\nthat thou art scarce worth.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nHadst thou not the privilege of antiquity upon thee—\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nDo not plunge thyself too far in anger, lest thou hasten thy trial;\\r\\nwhich if—Lord have mercy on thee for a hen!

I have a desire to hold my\\r\\nacquaintance with thee, or rather my knowledge, that I may say in the\\r\\ndefault, “He is a man I know.”\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nMy lord, you do me most insupportable vexation.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nI would it were hell-pains for thy sake, and my poor doing eternal; for\\r\\ndoing I am past, as I will by thee, in what motion age will give me\\r\\nleave.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exit._]\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nWell, thou hast a son shall take this disgrace off me; scurvy, old,\\r\\nfilthy, scurvy lord! Well, I must be patient; there is no fettering of\\r\\nauthority. I’ll beat him, by my life, if I can meet him with any\\r\\nconvenience, an he were double and double a lord.

Why dost thou garter up thy arms o’\\r\\nthis fashion? Dost make hose of thy sleeves? Do other servants so? Thou\\r\\nwert best set thy lower part where thy nose stands. By mine honour, if\\r\\nI were but two hours younger, I’d beat thee. Methink’st thou art a\\r\\ngeneral offence, and every man should beat thee. I think thou wast\\r\\ncreated for men to breathe themselves upon thee.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nThis is hard and undeserved measure, my lord.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nGo to, sir; you were beaten in Italy for picking a kernel out of a\\r\\npomegranate; you are a vagabond, and no true traveller. You are more\\r\\nsaucy with lords and honourable personages than the commission of your\\r\\nbirth and virtue gives you heraldry. You are not worth another word,\\r\\nelse I’d call you knave.

To th’ wars, my boy, to th’ wars!\\r\\nHe wears his honour in a box unseen\\r\\nThat hugs his kicky-wicky here at home,\\r\\nSpending his manly marrow in her arms,\\r\\nWhich should sustain the bound and high curvet\\r\\nOf Mars’s fiery steed.

To say nothing, to do nothing, to know nothing, and\\r\\nto have nothing, is to be a great part of your title; which is within a\\r\\nvery little of nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nAway! Thou art a knave.\\r\\n\\r\\nCLOWN.\\r\\nYou should have said, sir, before a knave thou art a knave; that is\\r\\nbefore me thou art a knave. This had been truth, sir.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nGo to, thou art a witty fool; I have found thee.\\r\\n\\r\\nCLOWN.\\r\\nDid you find me in yourself, sir? or were you taught to find me?

There was excellent\\r\\ncommand, to charge in with our horse upon our own wings, and to rend\\r\\nour own soldiers.\\r\\n\\r\\nSECOND LORD.\\r\\nThat was not to be blam’d in the command of the service; it was a\\r\\ndisaster of war that Caesar himself could not have prevented, if he had\\r\\nbeen there to command.\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nWell, we cannot greatly condemn our success: some dishonour we had in\\r\\nthe loss of that drum, but it is not to be recovered.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nIt might have been recovered.\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nIt might, but it is not now.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nIt is to be recovered.

But, fair soul,\\r\\nIn your fine frame hath love no quality?\\r\\nIf the quick fire of youth light not your mind,\\r\\nYou are no maiden but a monument;\\r\\nWhen you are dead, you should be such a one\\r\\nAs you are now; for you are cold and stern,\\r\\nAnd now you should be as your mother was\\r\\nWhen your sweet self was got.\\r\\n\\r\\nDIANA.\\r\\nShe then was honest.\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nSo should you be.\\r\\n\\r\\nDIANA.\\r\\nNo.\\r\\nMy mother did but duty; such, my lord,\\r\\nAs you owe to your wife.\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nNo more a’ that!\\r\\nI pr’ythee do not strive against my vows;\\r\\nI was compell’d to her; but I love thee\\r\\nBy love’s own sweet constraint, and will for ever\\r\\nDo thee all rights of service.\\r\\n\\r\\nDIANA.\\r\\nAy, so you serve us\\r\\nTill we serve you; but when you have our roses,\\r\\nYou barely leave our thorns to prick ourselves,\\r\\nAnd mock us with our bareness.\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nHow have I sworn?\\r\\n\\r\\nDIANA.\\r\\n’Tis not the many oaths that makes the truth,\\r\\nBut the plain single vow that is vow’d true.\\r\\nWhat is not holy, that we swear not by,\\r\\nBut take the highest to witness: then, pray you, tell me,\\r\\nIf I should swear by Jove’s great attributes\\r\\nI lov’d you dearly, would you believe my oaths\\r\\nWhen I did love you ill? This has no holding,\\r\\nTo swear by him whom I protest to love\\r\\nThat I will work against him.

I will tell you\\r\\na thing, but you shall let it dwell darkly with you.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST LORD.\\r\\nWhen you have spoken it, ’tis dead, and I am the grave of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nSECOND LORD.\\r\\nHe hath perverted a young gentlewoman here in Florence, of a most\\r\\nchaste renown, and this night he fleshes his will in the spoil of her\\r\\nhonour; he hath given her his monumental ring, and thinks himself made\\r\\nin the unchaste composition.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST LORD.\\r\\nNow, God delay our rebellion! As we are ourselves, what things are we!\\r\\n\\r\\nSECOND LORD.\\r\\nMerely our own traitors. And as in the common course of all treasons,\\r\\nwe still see them reveal themselves till they attain to their abhorr’d\\r\\nends; so he that in this action contrives against his own nobility, in\\r\\nhis proper stream, o’erflows himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST LORD.\\r\\nIs it not meant damnable in us to be trumpeters of our unlawful\\r\\nintents? We shall not then have his company tonight?\\r\\n\\r\\nSECOND LORD.\\r\\nNot till after midnight; for he is dieted to his hour.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST LORD.\\r\\nThat approaches apace. I would gladly have him see his company\\r\\nanatomized, that he might take a measure of his own judgments, wherein\\r\\nso curiously he had set this counterfeit.\\r\\n\\r\\nSECOND LORD.\\r\\nWe will not meddle with him till he come; for his presence must be the\\r\\nwhip of the other.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST LORD.\\r\\nIn the meantime, what hear you of these wars?\\r\\n\\r\\nSECOND LORD.\\r\\nI hear there is an overture of peace.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST LORD.\\r\\nNay, I assure you, a peace concluded.\\r\\n\\r\\nSECOND LORD.\\r\\nWhat will Count Rossillon do then? Will he travel higher, or return\\r\\nagain into France?\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST LORD.\\r\\nI perceive by this demand, you are not altogether of his council.\\r\\n\\r\\nSECOND LORD.\\r\\nLet it be forbid, sir! So should I be a great deal of his act.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST LORD.\\r\\nSir, his wife some two months since fled from his house. Her pretence\\r\\nis a pilgrimage to Saint Jaques le Grand; which holy undertaking with\\r\\nmost austere sanctimony she accomplished; and there residing, the\\r\\ntenderness of her nature became as a prey to her grief; in fine, made a\\r\\ngroan of her last breath, and now she sings in heaven.\\r\\n\\r\\nSECOND LORD.\\r\\nHow is this justified?\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST LORD.\\r\\nThe stronger part of it by her own letters, which makes her story true,\\r\\neven to the point of her death.

The great\\r\\ndignity that his valour hath here acquir’d for him shall at home be\\r\\nencountered with a shame as ample.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST LORD.\\r\\nThe web of our life is of a mingled yarn, good and ill together; our\\r\\nvirtues would be proud if our faults whipped them not; and our crimes\\r\\nwould despair if they were not cherish’d by our virtues.\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter a Messenger.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow now? Where’s your master?\\r\\n\\r\\nMESSENGER.\\r\\nHe met the duke in the street, sir; of whom he hath taken a solemn\\r\\nleave: his lordship will next morning for France. The duke hath offered\\r\\nhim letters of commendations to the king.\\r\\n\\r\\nSECOND LORD.\\r\\nThey shall be no more than needful there, if they were more than they\\r\\ncan commend.\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Bertram.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST LORD.\\r\\nThey cannot be too sweet for the king’s tartness. Here’s his lordship\\r\\nnow. How now, my lord, is’t not after midnight?\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nI have tonight despatch’d sixteen businesses, a month’s length apiece;\\r\\nby an abstract of success: I have congied with the duke, done my adieu\\r\\nwith his nearest; buried a wife, mourn’d for her, writ to my lady\\r\\nmother I am returning, entertained my convoy, and between these main\\r\\nparcels of despatch effected many nicer needs: the last was the\\r\\ngreatest, but that I have not ended yet.\\r\\n\\r\\nSECOND LORD.\\r\\nIf the business be of any difficulty and this morning your departure\\r\\nhence, it requires haste of your lordship.\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nI mean the business is not ended, as fearing to hear of it hereafter.\\r\\nBut shall we have this dialogue between the Fool and the Soldier? Come,\\r\\nbring forth this counterfeit module has deceiv’d me like a\\r\\ndouble-meaning prophesier.\\r\\n\\r\\nSECOND LORD.\\r\\nBring him forth.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exeunt Soldiers._]\\r\\n\\r\\nHas sat i’ the stocks all night, poor gallant knave.\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nNo matter; his heels have deserv’d it, in usurping his spurs so long.\\r\\nHow does he carry himself?\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST LORD.\\r\\nI have told your lordship already; the stocks carry him. But to answer\\r\\nyou as you would be understood: he weeps like a wench that had shed her\\r\\nmilk; he hath confessed himself to Morgan, whom he supposes to be a\\r\\nfriar, from the time of his remembrance to this very instant disaster\\r\\nof his setting i’ the stocks. And what think you he hath confessed?\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nNothing of me, has he?\\r\\n\\r\\nSECOND LORD.\\r\\nHis confession is taken, and it shall be read to his face; if your\\r\\nlordship be in’t, as I believe you are, you must have the patience to\\r\\nhear it.\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter Soldiers with Parolles.\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nA plague upon him! muffled! he can say nothing of me; hush, hush!\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST LORD.\\r\\nHoodman comes! _Portotartarossa._\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST SOLDIER.\\r\\nHe calls for the tortures. What will you say without ’em?\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nI will confess what I know without constraint.

I’ll take the sacrament on ’t, how and which way you will.\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nAll’s one to him. What a past-saving slave is this!\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST LORD.\\r\\nYou are deceived, my lord; this is Monsieur Parolles, the gallant\\r\\nmilitarist (that was his own phrase), that had the whole theoric of war\\r\\nin the knot of his scarf, and the practice in the chape of his dagger.\\r\\n\\r\\nSECOND LORD.\\r\\nI will never trust a man again for keeping his sword clean, nor believe\\r\\nhe can have everything in him by wearing his apparel neatly.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST SOLDIER.\\r\\nWell, that’s set down.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\n‘Five or six thousand horse’ I said—I will say true—or thereabouts, set\\r\\ndown,—for I’ll speak truth.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST LORD.\\r\\nHe’s very near the truth in this.\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nBut I con him no thanks for’t in the nature he delivers it.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nPoor rogues, I pray you say.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST SOLDIER.\\r\\nWell, that’s set down.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nI humbly thank you, sir; a truth’s a truth, the rogues are marvellous\\r\\npoor.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST SOLDIER.\\r\\n‘Demand of him of what strength they are a-foot.’ What say you to that?\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nBy my troth, sir, if I were to live this present hour, I will tell\\r\\ntrue. Let me see: Spurio, a hundred and fifty, Sebastian, so many;\\r\\nCorambus, so many; Jaques, so many; Guiltian, Cosmo, Lodowick, and\\r\\nGratii, two hundred fifty each; mine own company, Chitopher, Vaumond,\\r\\nBentii, two hundred fifty each: so that the muster-file, rotten and\\r\\nsound, upon my life, amounts not to fifteen thousand poll; half of the\\r\\nwhich dare not shake the snow from off their cassocks lest they shake\\r\\nthemselves to pieces.\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nWhat shall be done to him?\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST LORD.\\r\\nNothing, but let him have thanks. Demand of him my condition, and what\\r\\ncredit I have with the duke.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST SOLDIER.\\r\\nWell, that’s set down. ‘You shall demand of him whether one Captain\\r\\nDumaine be i’ the camp, a Frenchman; what his reputation is with the\\r\\nduke, what his valour, honesty and expertness in wars; or whether he\\r\\nthinks it were not possible with well-weighing sums of gold to corrupt\\r\\nhim to a revolt.’ What say you to this? What do you know of it?\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nI beseech you, let me answer to the particular of the inter’gatories.\\r\\nDemand them singly.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST SOLDIER.\\r\\nDo you know this Captain Dumaine?\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nI know him: he was a botcher’s ’prentice in Paris, from whence he was\\r\\nwhipped for getting the shrieve’s fool with child, a dumb innocent that\\r\\ncould not say him nay.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_First Lord lifts up his hand in anger._]\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nNay, by your leave, hold your hands; though I know his brains are\\r\\nforfeit to the next tile that falls.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST SOLDIER.\\r\\nWell, is this captain in the Duke of Florence’s camp?\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nUpon my knowledge, he is, and lousy.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST LORD.\\r\\nNay, look not so upon me; we shall hear of your lordship anon.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST SOLDIER.\\r\\nWhat is his reputation with the duke?\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nThe duke knows him for no other but a poor officer of mine, and writ to\\r\\nme this other day to turn him out o’ the band. I think I have his\\r\\nletter in my pocket.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST SOLDIER.\\r\\nMarry, we’ll search.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nIn good sadness, I do not know; either it is there or it is upon a\\r\\nfile, with the duke’s other letters, in my tent.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST SOLDIER.\\r\\nHere ’tis; here’s a paper; shall I read it to you?\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nI do not know if it be it or no.\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nOur interpreter does it well.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST LORD.\\r\\nExcellently.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST SOLDIER.\\r\\n[_Reads._] _Dian, the Count’s a fool, and full of gold._\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nThat is not the duke’s letter, sir; that is an advertisement to a\\r\\nproper maid in Florence, one Diana, to take heed of the allurement of\\r\\none Count Rossillon, a foolish idle boy, but for all that very ruttish.\\r\\nI pray you, sir, put it up again.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST SOLDIER.\\r\\nNay, I’ll read it first by your favour.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nMy meaning in’t, I protest, was very honest in the behalf of the maid;\\r\\nfor I knew the young count to be a dangerous and lascivious boy, who is\\r\\na whale to virginity, and devours up all the fry it finds.\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nDamnable both sides rogue!\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST SOLDIER.\\r\\n[_Reads._]\\r\\n_When he swears oaths, bid him drop gold, and take it;\\r\\nAfter he scores, he never pays the score.\\r\\nHalf won is match well made; match, and well make it;\\r\\nHe ne’er pays after-debts, take it before.\\r\\nAnd say a soldier, ‘Dian,’ told thee this:\\r\\nMen are to mell with, boys are not to kiss;\\r\\nFor count of this, the count’s a fool, I know it,\\r\\nWho pays before, but not when he does owe it.\\r\\nThine, as he vow’d to thee in thine ear,_\\r\\n                                     PAROLLES.\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nHe shall be whipped through the army with this rhyme in’s forehead.\\r\\n\\r\\nSECOND LORD.\\r\\nThis is your devoted friend, sir, the manifold linguist, and the\\r\\narmipotent soldier.\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nI could endure anything before but a cat, and now he’s a cat to me.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST SOLDIER.\\r\\nI perceive, sir, by our general’s looks we shall be fain to hang you.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nMy life, sir, in any case.

Therefore, once more\\r\\nto this Captain Dumaine: you have answer’d to his reputation with the\\r\\nduke, and to his valour. What is his honesty?\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nHe will steal, sir, an egg out of a cloister: for rapes and ravishments\\r\\nhe parallels Nessus. He professes not keeping of oaths; in breaking\\r\\nthem he is stronger than Hercules. He will lie, sir, with such\\r\\nvolubility that you would think truth were a fool: drunkenness is his\\r\\nbest virtue, for he will be swine-drunk, and in his sleep he does\\r\\nlittle harm, save to his bedclothes about him; but they know his\\r\\nconditions and lay him in straw. I have but little more to say, sir, of\\r\\nhis honesty; he has everything that an honest man should not have; what\\r\\nan honest man should have, he has nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST LORD.\\r\\nI begin to love him for this.\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nFor this description of thine honesty? A pox upon him for me, he’s more\\r\\nand more a cat.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST SOLDIER.\\r\\nWhat say you to his expertness in war?\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nFaith, sir, has led the drum before the English tragedians,—to belie\\r\\nhim I will not,—and more of his soldiership I know not, except in that\\r\\ncountry he had the honour to be the officer at a place there called\\r\\nMile-end, to instruct for the doubling of files. I would do the man\\r\\nwhat honour I can, but of this I am not certain.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST LORD.\\r\\nHe hath out-villain’d villainy so far that the rarity redeems him.\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nA pox on him! He’s a cat still.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST SOLDIER.\\r\\nHis qualities being at this poor price, I need not to ask you if gold\\r\\nwill corrupt him to revolt.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nSir, for a quart d’ecu he will sell the fee-simple of his salvation,\\r\\nthe inheritance of it, and cut the entail from all remainders, and a\\r\\nperpetual succession for it perpetually.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST SOLDIER.\\r\\nWhat’s his brother, the other Captain Dumaine?\\r\\n\\r\\nSECOND LORD.\\r\\nWhy does he ask him of me?\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST SOLDIER.\\r\\nWhat’s he?\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nE’en a crow o’ the same nest; not altogether so great as the first in\\r\\ngoodness, but greater a great deal in evil. He excels his brother for a\\r\\ncoward, yet his brother is reputed one of the best that is. In a\\r\\nretreat he outruns any lackey; marry, in coming on he has the cramp.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST SOLDIER.\\r\\nIf your life be saved, will you undertake to betray the Florentine?\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nAy, and the captain of his horse, Count Rossillon.\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST SOLDIER.\\r\\nI’ll whisper with the general, and know his pleasure.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\n[_Aside._] I’ll no more drumming; a plague of all drums!

The general says you that\\r\\nhave so traitorously discovered the secrets of your army, and made such\\r\\npestiferous reports of men very nobly held, can serve the world for no\\r\\nhonest use; therefore you must die.

I duly am inform’d\\r\\nHis grace is at Marseilles; to which place\\r\\nWe have convenient convoy. You must know\\r\\nI am supposed dead.

But, O strange men!\\r\\nThat can such sweet use make of what they hate,\\r\\nWhen saucy trusting of the cozen’d thoughts\\r\\nDefiles the pitchy night; so lust doth play\\r\\nWith what it loathes, for that which is away.\\r\\nBut more of this hereafter.

If she had\\r\\npartaken of my flesh and cost me the dearest groans of a mother, I\\r\\ncould not have owed her a more rooted love.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\n’Twas a good lady, ’twas a good lady. We may pick a thousand salads ere\\r\\nwe light on such another herb.\\r\\n\\r\\nCLOWN.\\r\\nIndeed, sir, she was the sweet marjoram of the salad, or, rather, the\\r\\nherb of grace.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nThey are not herbs, you knave; they are nose-herbs.\\r\\n\\r\\nCLOWN.\\r\\nI am no great Nebuchadnezzar, sir; I have not much skill in grass.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nWhether dost thou profess thyself,—a knave or a fool?\\r\\n\\r\\nCLOWN.\\r\\nA fool, sir, at a woman’s service, and a knave at a man’s.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nYour distinction?\\r\\n\\r\\nCLOWN.\\r\\nI would cozen the man of his wife, and do his service.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nSo you were a knave at his service indeed.\\r\\n\\r\\nCLOWN.\\r\\nAnd I would give his wife my bauble, sir, to do her service.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nI will subscribe for thee; thou art both knave and fool.\\r\\n\\r\\nCLOWN.\\r\\nAt your service.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nNo, no, no.\\r\\n\\r\\nCLOWN.\\r\\nWhy, sir, if I cannot serve you, I can serve as great a prince as you\\r\\nare.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nWho’s that? a Frenchman?\\r\\n\\r\\nCLOWN.\\r\\nFaith, sir, ’a has an English name; but his phisnomy is more hotter in\\r\\nFrance than there.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nWhat prince is that?\\r\\n\\r\\nCLOWN.\\r\\nThe black prince, sir; alias the prince of darkness; alias the devil.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nHold thee, there’s my purse.

And I was about to tell you, since I\\r\\nheard of the good lady’s death, and that my lord your son was upon his\\r\\nreturn home, I moved the king my master to speak in the behalf of my\\r\\ndaughter; which, in the minority of them both, his majesty out of a\\r\\nself-gracious remembrance did first propose.

I will henceforth eat no fish of Fortune’s\\r\\nbuttering. Pr’ythee, allow the wind.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nNay, you need not to stop your nose, sir. I spake but by a metaphor.\\r\\n\\r\\nCLOWN.\\r\\nIndeed, sir, if your metaphor stink, I will stop my nose, or against\\r\\nany man’s metaphor.

Pray you, sir, use the carp as you\\r\\nmay, for he looks like a poor, decayed, ingenious, foolish, rascally\\r\\nknave. I do pity his distress in my similes of comfort, and leave him\\r\\nto your lordship.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exit._]\\r\\n\\r\\nPAROLLES.\\r\\nMy lord, I am a man whom Fortune hath cruelly scratch’d.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nAnd what would you have me to do? ’Tis too late to pare her nails now.\\r\\nWherein have you played the knave with Fortune that she should scratch\\r\\nyou, who of herself is a good lady, and would not have knaves thrive\\r\\nlong under her?

You remember\\r\\nThe daughter of this lord?\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nAdmiringly, my liege. At first\\r\\nI stuck my choice upon her, ere my heart\\r\\nDurst make too bold herald of my tongue:\\r\\nWhere the impression of mine eye infixing,\\r\\nContempt his scornful perspective did lend me,\\r\\nWhich warp’d the line of every other favour,\\r\\nScorn’d a fair colour, or express’d it stolen,\\r\\nExtended or contracted all proportions\\r\\nTo a most hideous object. Thence it came\\r\\nThat she whom all men prais’d, and whom myself,\\r\\nSince I have lost, have lov’d, was in mine eye\\r\\nThe dust that did offend it.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nWell excus’d:\\r\\nThat thou didst love her, strikes some scores away\\r\\nFrom the great compt: but love that comes too late,\\r\\nLike a remorseful pardon slowly carried,\\r\\nTo the great sender turns a sour offence,\\r\\nCrying, That’s good that’s gone. Our rash faults\\r\\nMake trivial price of serious things we have,\\r\\nNot knowing them until we know their grave.\\r\\nOft our displeasures, to ourselves unjust,\\r\\nDestroy our friends, and after weep their dust:\\r\\nOur own love waking cries to see what’s done,\\r\\nWhile shameful hate sleeps out the afternoon.\\r\\nBe this sweet Helen’s knell, and now forget her.\\r\\nSend forth your amorous token for fair Maudlin.\\r\\nThe main consents are had, and here we’ll stay\\r\\nTo see our widower’s second marriage-day.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nWhich better than the first, O dear heaven, bless!\\r\\nOr, ere they meet, in me, O nature, cesse!\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nCome on, my son, in whom my house’s name\\r\\nMust be digested; give a favour from you,\\r\\nTo sparkle in the spirits of my daughter,\\r\\nThat she may quickly come.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Bertram gives a ring to Lafew._]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy my old beard,\\r\\nAnd ev’ry hair that’s on ’t, Helen that’s dead\\r\\nWas a sweet creature: such a ring as this,\\r\\nThe last that e’er I took her leave at court,\\r\\nI saw upon her finger.\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nHers it was not.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nNow, pray you, let me see it; for mine eye,\\r\\nWhile I was speaking, oft was fasten’d to it.\\r\\nThis ring was mine; and when I gave it Helen\\r\\nI bade her, if her fortunes ever stood\\r\\nNecessitied to help, that by this token\\r\\nI would relieve her. Had you that craft to ’reave her\\r\\nOf what should stead her most?\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nMy gracious sovereign,\\r\\nHowe’er it pleases you to take it so,\\r\\nThe ring was never hers.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOUNTESS.\\r\\nSon, on my life,\\r\\nI have seen her wear it; and she reckon’d it\\r\\nAt her life’s rate.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nI am sure I saw her wear it.\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nYou are deceiv’d, my lord; she never saw it.\\r\\nIn Florence was it from a casement thrown me,\\r\\nWrapp’d in a paper, which contain’d the name\\r\\nOf her that threw it. Noble she was, and thought\\r\\nI stood engag’d; but when I had subscrib’d\\r\\nTo mine own fortune, and inform’d her fully\\r\\nI could not answer in that course of honour\\r\\nAs she had made the overture, she ceas’d,\\r\\nIn heavy satisfaction, and would never\\r\\nReceive the ring again.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nPlutus himself,\\r\\nThat knows the tinct and multiplying medicine,\\r\\nHath not in nature’s mystery more science\\r\\nThan I have in this ring. ’Twas mine, ’twas Helen’s,\\r\\nWhoever gave it you. Then if you know\\r\\nThat you are well acquainted with yourself,\\r\\nConfess ’twas hers, and by what rough enforcement\\r\\nYou got it from her. She call’d the saints to surety\\r\\nThat she would never put it from her finger\\r\\nUnless she gave it to yourself in bed,\\r\\nWhere you have never come, or sent it us\\r\\nUpon her great disaster.\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nShe never saw it.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nThou speak’st it falsely, as I love mine honour,\\r\\nAnd mak’st conjectural fears to come into me\\r\\nWhich I would fain shut out. If it should prove\\r\\nThat thou art so inhuman,—’twill not prove so:\\r\\nAnd yet I know not, thou didst hate her deadly.\\r\\nAnd she is dead; which nothing but to close\\r\\nHer eyes myself, could win me to believe\\r\\nMore than to see this ring. Take him away.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Guards seize Bertram._]\\r\\n\\r\\nMy fore-past proofs, howe’er the matter fall,\\r\\nShall tax my fears of little vanity,\\r\\nHaving vainly fear’d too little. Away with him.\\r\\nWe’ll sift this matter further.\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nIf you shall prove\\r\\nThis ring was ever hers, you shall as easy\\r\\nProve that I husbanded her bed in Florence,\\r\\nWhere she yet never was.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exit, guarded._]\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nI am wrapp’d in dismal thinkings.\\r\\n\\r\\n Enter a Gentleman.\\r\\n\\r\\nGENTLEMAN.\\r\\nGracious sovereign,\\r\\nWhether I have been to blame or no, I know not:\\r\\nHere’s a petition from a Florentine,\\r\\nWho hath for four or five removes come short\\r\\nTo tender it herself. I undertook it,\\r\\nVanquish’d thereto by the fair grace and speech\\r\\nOf the poor suppliant, who by this, I know,\\r\\nIs here attending: her business looks in her\\r\\nWith an importing visage, and she told me\\r\\nIn a sweet verbal brief, it did concern\\r\\nYour highness with herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\n[_Reads._] _Upon his many protestations to marry me when his wife was\\r\\ndead, I blush to say it, he won me.

I did go between them as I said; but more\\r\\nthan that, he loved her, for indeed he was mad for her, and talked of\\r\\nSatan, and of Limbo, and of furies, and I know not what: yet I was in\\r\\nthat credit with them at that time that I knew of their going to bed;\\r\\nand of other motions, as promising her marriage, and things which would\\r\\nderive me ill will to speak of; therefore I will not speak what I know.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nThou hast spoken all already, unless thou canst say they are married;\\r\\nbut thou art too fine in thy evidence; therefore stand aside.

O, pardon!\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nO, my good lord, when I was like this maid;\\r\\nI found you wondrous kind. There is your ring,\\r\\nAnd, look you, here’s your letter. This it says,\\r\\n‘When from my finger you can get this ring,\\r\\nAnd is by me with child, &c.’ This is done;\\r\\nWill you be mine now you are doubly won?\\r\\n\\r\\nBERTRAM.\\r\\nIf she, my liege, can make me know this clearly,\\r\\nI’ll love her dearly, ever, ever dearly.\\r\\n\\r\\nHELENA.\\r\\nIf it appear not plain, and prove untrue,\\r\\nDeadly divorce step between me and you!\\r\\nO my dear mother, do I see you living?\\r\\n\\r\\nLAFEW.\\r\\nMine eyes smell onions; I shall weep anon.\\r\\n[_to Parolles_] Good Tom Drum, lend me a handkercher.\\r\\nSo, I thank thee. Wait on me home, I’ll make sport with thee.\\r\\nLet thy courtesies alone, they are scurvy ones.\\r\\n\\r\\nKING.\\r\\nLet us from point to point this story know,\\r\\nTo make the even truth in pleasure flow.\\r\\n[_To Diana._] If thou beest yet a fresh uncropped flower,\\r\\nChoose thou thy husband, and I’ll pay thy dower;\\r\\nFor I can guess that by thy honest aid,\\r\\nThou kept’st a wife herself, thyself a maid.\\r\\nOf that and all the progress more and less,\\r\\nResolvedly more leisure shall express.\\r\\nAll yet seems well, and if it end so meet,\\r\\nThe bitter past, more welcome is the sweet.\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Flourish._]\\r\\n\\r\\n[EPILOGUE]\\r\\n\\r\\n_The king’s a beggar, now the play is done;\\r\\nAll is well ended if this suit be won,\\r\\nThat you express content; which we will pay\\r\\nWith strife to please you, day exceeding day.\\r\\nOurs be your patience then, and yours our parts;\\r\\nYour gentle hands lend us, and take our hearts._\\r\\n\\r\\n [_Exeunt omnes._]\\r\\n'"

              "' myself.  SALARINO. Your mind is tossing on the ocean, There where your argosies, with portly sail Like signiors and rich burghers on the flood, Or as it were the pageants of the sea, Do overpeer the petty traffickers That curtsy to them, do them reverence, As they fly by them with their woven wings.  SOLANIO. Believe me, sir, had I such venture forth, The better part of my affections would Be with my hopes abroad. I should be still Plucking the grass to know where sits the wind, Peering in maps for ports, and piers and roads; And every object that might make me fear Misfortune to my ventures, out of doubt Would make me sad.  SALARINO. My wind cooling my broth Would blow me to an ague when I thought What harm a wind too great might do at sea. I should not see the sandy hour-glass run But I should think of shallows and of flats, And see my wealthy Andrew dock’d in sand, Vailing her high top lower than her ribs To kiss her burial. Should I go to church And see the holy edifice of stone And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks, Which, touching but my gentle vessel’s side, Would scatter all her spices on the stream, Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks, And, in a word, but even now worth this, And now worth nothing? Shall I have the thought To think on this, and shall I lack the thought That such a thing bechanc’d would make me sad? But tell not me, I know Antonio Is sad to think upon his merchandise.  ANTONIO. Believe me, no. I thank my fortune for it, My ventures are not in one bottom trusted, Nor to one place; nor is my whole estate Upon the fortune of this present year. Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad.  SALARINO. Why then you are in love.  ANTONIO. Fie, fie!  SALARINO. Not in love neither? Then let us say you are sad Because you are not merry; and ’twere as easy For you to laugh and leap and say you are merry Because you are not sad. Now, by two-headed Janus, Nature hath fram’d strange fellows in her time: Some that will evermore peep through their eyes, And laugh like parrots at a bagpiper. And other of such vinegar aspect That they’ll not show their teeth in way of smile Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable.   Enter Bassanio, Lorenzo and Gratiano.  SOLANIO. Here comes Bassanio, your most noble kinsman, Gratiano, and Lorenzo. Fare ye well. We leave you now with better company.  SALARINO. I would have stay’d till I had made you merry, If worthier friends had not prevented me.  ANTONIO. Your worth is very dear in my regard. I take it your own business calls on you, And you embrace th’ occasion to depart.  SALARINO. Good morrow, my good lords.  BASSANIO. Good signiors both, when shall we laugh? Say, when? You grow exceeding strange. Must it be so?  SALARINO. We’ll make our leisures to attend on yours.   [_Exeunt Salarino and Solanio._]  LORENZO. My Lord Bassanio, since you have found Antonio, We two will leave you, but at dinner-time I pray you have in mind where we must meet.  BASSANIO. I will not fail you.  GRATIANO. You look not well, Signior Antonio, You have too much respect upon the world. They lose it that do buy it with much care. Believe me, you are marvellously chang’d.  ANTONIO. I hold the world but as the world, Gratiano, A stage, where every man must play a part, And mine a sad one.  GRATIANO. Let me play the fool, With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come, And let my liver rather heat with wine Than my heart cool with mortifying groans. Why should a man whose blood is warm within Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster? Sleep when he wakes? And creep into the jaundice By being peevish? I tell thee what, Antonio, (I love thee, and ’tis my love that speaks): There are a sort of men whose visages Do cream and mantle like a standing pond, And do a wilful stillness entertain, With purpose to be dress’d in an opinion Of wisdom, gravity, profound conceit, As who should say, “I am Sir Oracle, And when I ope my lips, let no dog bark.” O my Antonio, I do know of these That therefore only are reputed wise For saying nothing; when, I am very sure, If they should speak, would almost damn those ears Which, hearing them, would call their brothers fools. I’ll tell thee more of this another time. But fish not with this melancholy bait For this fool gudgeon, this opinion. Come, good Lorenzo. Fare ye well a while. I’ll end my exhortation after dinner.  LORENZO. Well, we will leave you then till dinner-time. I must be one of these same dumb wise men, For Gratiano never lets me speak.  GRATIANO. Well, keep me company but two years moe, Thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue.  ANTONIO. Fare you well. I’ll grow a talker for this gear.  GRATIANO. Thanks, i’ faith, for silence is only commendable In a neat’s tongue dried, and a maid not vendible.   [_Exeunt Gratiano and Lorenzo._]  ANTONIO. Is that anything now?  BASSANIO. Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing, more than any man in all Venice. His reasons are as two grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff: you shall seek all day ere you find them, and when you have them they are not worth the search.  ANTONIO. Well, tell me now what lady is the same To whom you swore a secret pilgrimage, That you today promis’d to tell me of?  BASSANIO. ’Tis not unknown to you, Antonio, How much I have disabled mine estate By something showing a more swelling port Than my faint means would grant continuance. Nor do I now make moan to be abridg’d From such a noble rate, but my chief care Is to come fairly off from the great debts Wherein my time, something too prodigal, Hath left me gag’d. To you, Antonio, I owe the most in money and in love, And from your love I have a warranty To unburden all my plots and purposes How to get clear of all the debts I owe.  ANTONIO. I pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it; And if it stand, as you yourself still do, Within the eye of honour, be assur’d My purse, my person, my extremest means Lie all unlock’d to your occasions.  BASSANIO. In my school-days, when I had lost one shaft, I shot his fellow of the self-same flight The self-same way, with more advised watch To find the other forth; and by adventuring both I oft found both. I urge this childhood proof Because what follows is pure innocence. I owe you much, and, like a wilful youth, That which I owe is lost. But if you please To shoot another arrow that self way Which you did shoot the first, I do not doubt, As I will watch the aim, or to find both, Or bring your latter hazard back again, And thankfully rest debtor for the first.  ANTONIO. You know me well, and herein spend but time To wind about my love with circumstance; And out of doubt you do me now more wrong In making question of my uttermost Than if you had made waste of all I have. Then do but say to me what I should do That in your knowledge may by me be done, And I am prest unto it. Therefore, speak.  BASSANIO. In Belmont is a lady richly left, And she is fair, and, fairer than that word, Of wondrous virtues. Sometimes from her eyes I did receive fair speechless messages: Her name is Portia, nothing undervalu’d To Cato’s daughter, Brutus’ Portia. Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth, For the four winds blow in from every coast Renowned suitors, and her sunny locks Hang on her temples like a golden fleece, Which makes her seat of Belmont Colchos’ strond, And many Jasons come in quest of her. O my Antonio, had I but the means To hold a rival place with one of them, I have a mind presages me such thrift That I should questionless be fortunate.  ANTONIO. Thou know’st that all my fortunes are at sea; Neither have I money nor commodity To raise a present sum, therefore go forth Try what my credit can in Venice do; That shall be rack’d even to the uttermost, To furnish thee to Belmont to fair Portia. Go presently inquire, and so will I, Where money is, and I no question make To have it of my trust or for my sake.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE II. Belmont. A room in Portia’s house.   Enter Portia with her waiting-woman Nerissa.  PORTIA. By my troth, Nerissa, my little body is aweary of this great world.  NERISSA. You would be, sweet madam, if your miseries were in the same abundance as your good fortunes are. And yet, for aught I see, they are as sick that surfeit with too much as they that starve with nothing. It is no mean happiness, therefore, to be seated in the mean. Superfluity come sooner by white hairs, but competency lives longer.  PORTIA. Good sentences, and well pronounc’d.  NERISSA. They would be better if well followed.  PORTIA. If to do were as easy as to know what were good to do, chapels had been churches, and poor men’s cottages princes’ palaces. It is a good divine that follows his own instructions; I can easier teach twenty what were good to be done than to be one of the twenty to follow mine own teaching. The brain may devise laws for the blood, but a hot temper leaps o’er a cold decree; such a hare is madness the youth, to skip o’er the meshes of good counsel the cripple. But this reasoning is not in the fashion to choose me a husband. O me, the word “choose”! I may neither choose who I would nor refuse who I dislike, so is the will of a living daughter curb’d by the will of a dead father. Is it not hard, Nerissa, that I cannot choose one, nor refuse none?  NERISSA. Your father was ever virtuous, and holy men at their death have good inspirations. Therefore the lott’ry that he hath devised in these three chests of gold, silver, and lead, whereof who chooses his meaning chooses you, will no doubt never be chosen by any rightly but one who you shall rightly love. But what warmth is there in your affection towards any of these princely suitors that are already come?  PORTIA. I pray thee over-name them, and as thou namest them, I will describe them, and according to my description level at my affection.  NERISSA. First, there is the Neapolitan prince.  PORTIA. Ay, that’s a colt indeed, for he doth nothing but talk of his horse, and he makes it a great appropriation to his own good parts that he can shoe him himself. I am much afeard my lady his mother play’d false with a smith.  NERISSA. Then is there the County Palatine.  PORTIA. He doth nothing but frown, as who should say “And you will not have me, choose.” He hears merry tales and smiles not. I fear he will prove the weeping philosopher when he grows old, being so full of unmannerly sadness in his youth. I had rather be married to a death’s-head with a bone in his mouth than to either of these. God defend me from these two!  NERISSA. How say you by the French lord, Monsieur Le Bon?  PORTIA. God made him, and therefore let him pass for a man. In truth, I know it is a sin to be a mocker, but he! why, he hath a horse better than the Neapolitan’s, a better bad habit of frowning than the Count Palatine. He is every man in no man. If a throstle sing, he falls straight a-cap’ring. He will fence with his own shadow. If I should marry him, I should marry twenty husbands. If he would despise me, I would forgive him, for if he love me to madness, I shall never requite him.  NERISSA. What say you then to Falconbridge, the young baron of England?  PORTIA. You know I say nothing to him, for he understands not me, nor I him: he hath neither Latin, French, nor Italian, and you will come into the court and swear that I have a poor pennyworth in the English. He is a proper man’s picture; but alas, who can converse with a dumb-show? How oddly he is suited! I think he bought his doublet in Italy, his round hose in France, his bonnet in Germany, and his behaviour everywhere.  NERISSA. What think you of the Scottish lord, his neighbour?  PORTIA. That he hath a neighbourly charity in him, for he borrowed a box of the ear of the Englishman, and swore he would pay him again when he was able. I think the Frenchman became his surety, and seal’d under for another.  NERISSA. How like you the young German, the Duke of Saxony’s nephew?  PORTIA. Very vilely in the morning when he is sober, and most vilely in the afternoon when he is drunk: when he is best, he is a little worse than a man, and when he is worst, he is little better than a beast. And the worst fall that ever fell, I hope I shall make shift to go without him.  NERISSA. If he should offer to choose, and choose the right casket, you should refuse to perform your father’s will, if you should refuse to accept him.  PORTIA. Therefore, for fear of the worst, I pray thee set a deep glass of Rhenish wine on the contrary casket, for if the devil be within and that temptation without, I know he will choose it. I will do anything, Nerissa, ere I will be married to a sponge.  NERISSA. You need not fear, lady, the having any of these lords. They have acquainted me with their determinations, which is indeed to return to their home, and to trouble you with no more suit, unless you may be won by some other sort than your father’s imposition, depending on the caskets.  PORTIA. If I live to be as old as Sibylla, I will die as chaste as Diana, unless I be obtained by the manner of my father’s will. I am glad this parcel of wooers are so reasonable, for there is not one among them but I dote on his very absence. And I pray God grant them a fair departure.  NERISSA. Do you not remember, lady, in your father’s time, a Venetian, a scholar and a soldier, that came hither in company of the Marquis of Montferrat?  PORTIA. Yes, yes, it was Bassanio, as I think, so was he call’d.  NERISSA. True, madam. He, of all the men that ever my foolish eyes look’d upon, was the best deserving a fair lady.  PORTIA. I remember him well, and I remember him worthy of thy praise.   Enter a Servingman.  How now! what news?  SERVINGMAN. The four strangers seek for you, madam, to take their leave. And there is a forerunner come from a fifth, the Prince of Morocco, who brings word the Prince his master will be here tonight.  PORTIA. If I could bid the fifth welcome with so good heart as I can bid the other four farewell, I should be glad of his approach. If he have the condition of a saint and the complexion of a devil, I had rather he should shrive me than wive me. Come, Nerissa. Sirrah, go before. Whiles we shut the gate upon one wooer, another knocks at the door.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE III. Venice. A public place.   Enter Bassanio with Shylock the Jew.  SHYLOCK. Three thousand ducats, well.  BASSANIO. Ay, sir, for three months.  SHYLOCK. For three months, well.  BASSANIO. For the which, as I told you, Antonio shall be bound.  SHYLOCK. Antonio shall become bound, well.  BASSANIO. May you stead me? Will you pleasure me? Shall I know your answer?  SHYLOCK. Three thousand ducats for three months, and Antonio bound.  BASSANIO. Your answer to that.  SHYLOCK. Antonio is a good man.  BASSANIO. Have you heard any imputation to the contrary?  SHYLOCK. Ho, no, no, no, no: my meaning in saying he is a good man is to have you understand me that he is sufficient. Yet his means are in supposition: he hath an argosy bound to Tripolis, another to the Indies. I understand, moreover, upon the Rialto, he hath a third at Mexico, a fourth for England, and other ventures he hath squandered abroad. But ships are but boards, sailors but men; there be land-rats and water-rats, water-thieves and land-thieves—I mean pirates—and then there is the peril of waters, winds, and rocks. The man is, notwithstanding, sufficient. Three thousand ducats. I think I may take his bond.  BASSANIO. Be assured you may.  SHYLOCK. I will be assured I may. And that I may be assured, I will bethink me. May I speak with Antonio?  BASSANIO. If it please you to dine with us.  SHYLOCK. Yes, to smell pork, to eat of the habitation which your prophet, the Nazarite, conjured the devil into. I will buy with you, sell with you, talk with you, walk with you, and so following; but I will not eat with you, drink with you, nor pray with you. What news on the Rialto? Who is he comes here?   Enter Antonio.  BASSANIO. This is Signior Antonio.  SHYLOCK. [_Aside._] How like a fawning publican he looks! I hate him for he is a Christian, But more for that in low simplicity He lends out money gratis, and brings down The rate of usance here with us in Venice. If I can catch him once upon the hip, I will feed fat the ancient grudge I bear him. He hates our sacred nation, and he rails, Even there where merchants most do congregate, On me, my bargains, and my well-won thrift, Which he calls interest. Cursed be my tribe If I forgive him!  BASSANIO. Shylock, do you hear?  SHYLOCK. I am debating of my present store, And by the near guess of my memory I cannot instantly raise up the gross Of full three thousand ducats. What of that? Tubal, a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe, Will furnish me. But soft! how many months Do you desire? [_To Antonio._] Rest you fair, good signior, Your worship was the last man in our mouths.  ANTONIO. Shylock, albeit I neither lend nor borrow By taking nor by giving of excess, Yet to supply the ripe wants of my friend, I’ll break a custom. [_To Bassanio._] Is he yet possess’d How much ye would?  SHYLOCK. Ay, ay, three thousand ducats.  ANTONIO. And for three months.  SHYLOCK. I had forgot, three months, you told me so. Well then, your bond. And let me see, but hear you, Methought you said you neither lend nor borrow Upon advantage.  ANTONIO. I do never use it.  SHYLOCK. When Jacob graz’d his uncle Laban’s sheep,— This Jacob from our holy Abram was As his wise mother wrought in his behalf, The third possessor; ay, he was the third.  ANTONIO. And what of him? Did he take interest?  SHYLOCK. No, not take interest, not, as you would say, Directly interest; mark what Jacob did. When Laban and himself were compromis’d That all the eanlings which were streak’d and pied Should fall as Jacob’s hire, the ewes being rank In end of autumn turned to the rams, And when the work of generation was Between these woolly breeders in the act, The skilful shepherd pill’d me certain wands, And in the doing of the deed of kind, He stuck them up before the fulsome ewes, Who then conceiving did in eaning time Fall parti-colour’d lambs, and those were Jacob’s. This was a way to thrive, and he was blest; And thrift is blessing if men steal it not.  ANTONIO. This was a venture, sir, that Jacob serv’d for, A thing not in his power to bring to pass, But sway’d and fashion’d by the hand of heaven. Was this inserted to make interest good? Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams?  SHYLOCK. I cannot tell; I make it breed as fast. But note me, signior.  ANTONIO. Mark you this, Bassanio, The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose. An evil soul producing holy witness Is like a villain with a smiling cheek, A goodly apple rotten at the heart. O, what a goodly outside falsehood hath!  SHYLOCK. Three thousand ducats, ’tis a good round sum. Three months from twelve, then let me see the rate.  ANTONIO. Well, Shylock, shall we be beholding to you?  SHYLOCK. Signior Antonio, many a time and oft In the Rialto you have rated me About my moneys and my usances. Still have I borne it with a patient shrug, (For suff’rance is the badge of all our tribe.) You call me misbeliever, cut-throat dog, And spet upon my Jewish gaberdine, And all for use of that which is mine own. Well then, it now appears you need my help. Go to, then, you come to me, and you say “Shylock, we would have moneys.” You say so: You that did void your rheum upon my beard, And foot me as you spurn a stranger cur Over your threshold, moneys is your suit. What should I say to you? Should I not say “Hath a dog money? Is it possible A cur can lend three thousand ducats?” Or Shall I bend low and, in a bondman’s key, With bated breath and whisp’ring humbleness, Say this: “Fair sir, you spet on me on Wednesday last; You spurn’d me such a day; another time You call’d me dog; and for these courtesies I’ll lend you thus much moneys”?  ANTONIO. I am as like to call thee so again, To spet on thee again, to spurn thee too. If thou wilt lend this money, lend it not As to thy friends, for when did friendship take A breed for barren metal of his friend? But lend it rather to thine enemy, Who if he break, thou mayst with better face Exact the penalty.  SHYLOCK. Why, look you how you storm! I would be friends with you, and have your love, Forget the shames that you have stain’d me with, Supply your present wants, and take no doit Of usance for my moneys, and you’ll not hear me, This is kind I offer.  BASSANIO. This were kindness.  SHYLOCK. This kindness will I show. Go with me to a notary, seal me there Your single bond; and in a merry sport, If you repay me not on such a day, In such a place, such sum or sums as are Express’d in the condition, let the forfeit Be nominated for an equal pound Of your fair flesh, to be cut off and taken In what part of your body pleaseth me.  ANTONIO. Content, in faith, I’ll seal to such a bond, And say there is much kindness in the Jew.  BASSANIO. You shall not seal to such a bond for me, I’ll rather dwell in my necessity.  ANTONIO. Why, fear not, man, I will not forfeit it, Within these two months, that’s a month before This bond expires, I do expect return Of thrice three times the value of this bond.  SHYLOCK. O father Abram, what these Christians are, Whose own hard dealings teaches them suspect The thoughts of others. Pray you, tell me this, If he should break his day, what should I gain By the exaction of the forfeiture? A pound of man’s flesh, taken from a man, Is not so estimable, profitable neither, As flesh of muttons, beefs, or goats. I say, To buy his favour, I extend this friendship. If he will take it, so. If not, adieu, And for my love I pray you wrong me not.  ANTONIO. Yes, Shylock, I will seal unto this bond.  SHYLOCK. Then meet me forthwith at the notary’s, Give him direction for this merry bond, And I will go and purse the ducats straight, See to my house left in the fearful guard Of an unthrifty knave, and presently I’ll be with you.  ANTONIO. Hie thee, gentle Jew.   [_Exit Shylock._]  This Hebrew will turn Christian; he grows kind.  BASSANIO. I like not fair terms and a villain’s mind.  ANTONIO. Come on; in this there can be no dismay; My ships come home a month before the day.   [_Exeunt._]   ACT II  SCENE I. Belmont. A room in Portia’s house.   Flourish of cornets. Enter the Prince of Morocco, a tawny Moor all in  white, and three or four followers accordingly, with Portia, Nerissa  and their train.  PRINCE OF MOROCCO. Mislike me not for my complexion, The shadowed livery of the burnish’d sun, To whom I am a neighbour, and near bred. Bring me the fairest creature northward born, Where Phœbus’ fire scarce thaws the icicles, And let us make incision for your love To prove whose blood is reddest, his or mine. I tell thee, lady, this aspect of mine Hath fear’d the valiant; by my love I swear The best-regarded virgins of our clime Have lov’d it too. I would not change this hue, Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.  PORTIA. In terms of choice I am not solely led By nice direction of a maiden’s eyes; Besides, the lott’ry of my destiny Bars me the right of voluntary choosing. But if my father had not scanted me And hedg’d me by his wit to yield myself His wife who wins me by that means I told you, Yourself, renowned Prince, then stood as fair As any comer I have look’d on yet For my affection.  PRINCE OF MOROCCO. Even for that I thank you. Therefore I pray you lead me to the caskets To try my fortune. By this scimitar That slew the Sophy and a Persian prince, That won three fields of Sultan Solyman, I would o’erstare the sternest eyes that look, Outbrave the heart most daring on the earth, Pluck the young sucking cubs from the she-bear, Yea, mock the lion when he roars for prey, To win thee, lady. But, alas the while! If Hercules and Lichas play at dice Which is the better man, the greater throw May turn by fortune from the weaker hand: So is Alcides beaten by his rage, And so may I, blind Fortune leading me, Miss that which one unworthier may attain, And die with grieving.  PORTIA. You must take your chance, And either not attempt to choose at all, Or swear before you choose, if you choose wrong Never to speak to lady afterward In way of marriage. Therefore be advis’d.  PRINCE OF MOROCCO. Nor will not. Come, bring me unto my chance.  PORTIA. First, forward to the temple. After dinner Your hazard shall be made.  PRINCE OF MOROCCO. Good fortune then, To make me blest or cursed’st among men!   [_Cornets. Exeunt._]  SCENE II. Venice. A street.   Enter Launcelet Gobbo, the clown, alone.  LAUNCELET. Certainly my conscience will serve me to run from this Jew my master. The fiend is at mine elbow and tempts me, saying to me “Gobbo, Launcelet Gobbo, good Launcelet” or “good Gobbo,” or “good Launcelet Gobbo, use your legs, take the start, run away.” My conscience says “No; take heed, honest Launcelet, take heed, honest Gobbo” or, as aforesaid, “honest Launcelet Gobbo, do not run, scorn running with thy heels.” Well, the most courageous fiend bids me pack. “Fia!” says the fiend, “away!” says the fiend. “For the heavens, rouse up a brave mind,” says the fiend “and run.” Well, my conscience, hanging about the neck of my heart, says very wisely to me “My honest friend Launcelet, being an honest man’s son”—or rather an honest woman’s son, for indeed my father did something smack, something grow to, he had a kind of taste;—well, my conscience says “Launcelet, budge not.” “Budge,” says the fiend. “Budge not,” says my conscience. “Conscience,” say I, “you counsel well.” “Fiend,” say I, “you counsel well.” To be ruled by my conscience, I should stay with the Jew my master, who, (God bless the mark) is a kind of devil; and, to run away from the Jew, I should be ruled by the fiend, who (saving your reverence) is the devil himself. Certainly the Jew is the very devil incarnation, and, in my conscience, my conscience is but a kind of hard conscience, to offer to counsel me to stay with the Jew. The fiend gives the more friendly counsel. I will run, fiend, my heels are at your commandment, I will run.   Enter Old Gobbo with a basket.  GOBBO. Master young man, you, I pray you; which is the way to Master Jew’s?  LAUNCELET. [_Aside._] O heavens, this is my true-begotten father, who being more than sand-blind, high-gravel blind, knows me not. I will try confusions with him.  GOBBO. Master young gentleman, I pray you, which is the way to Master Jew’s?  LAUNCELET. Turn up on your right hand at the next turning, but at the next turning of all on your left; marry, at the very next turning, turn of no hand, but turn down indirectly to the Jew’s house.  GOBBO. Be God’s sonties, ’twill be a hard way to hit. Can you tell me whether one Launcelet, that dwells with him, dwell with him or no?  LAUNCELET. Talk you of young Master Launcelet? [_Aside._] Mark me now, now will I raise the waters. Talk you of young Master Launcelet?  GOBBO. No master, sir, but a poor man’s son, his father, though I say’t, is an honest exceeding poor man, and, God be thanked, well to live.  LAUNCELET. Well, let his father be what he will, we talk of young Master Launcelet.  GOBBO. Your worship’s friend, and Launcelet, sir.  LAUNCELET. But I pray you, _ergo_, old man, _ergo_, I beseech you, talk you of young Master Launcelet?  GOBBO. Of Launcelet, an’t please your mastership.  LAUNCELET. _Ergo_, Master Launcelet. Talk not of Master Launcelet, father, for the young gentleman, according to Fates and Destinies, and such odd sayings, the Sisters Three and such branches of learning, is indeed deceased, or, as you would say in plain terms, gone to heaven.  GOBBO. Marry, God forbid! The boy was the very staff of my age, my very prop.  LAUNCELET. [_Aside._] Do I look like a cudgel or a hovel-post, a staff or a prop? Do you know me, father?  GOBBO. Alack the day! I know you not, young gentleman, but I pray you tell me, is my boy, God rest his soul, alive or dead?  LAUNCELET. Do you not know me, father?  GOBBO. Alack, sir, I am sand-blind, I know you not.  LAUNCELET. Nay, indeed, if you had your eyes, you might fail of the knowing me: it is a wise father that knows his own child. Well, old man, I will tell you news of your son. Give me your blessing, truth will come to light, murder cannot be hid long, a man’s son may, but in the end truth will out.  GOBBO. Pray you, sir, stand up, I am sure you are not Launcelet my boy.  LAUNCELET. Pray you, let’s have no more fooling about it, but give me your blessing. I am Launcelet, your boy that was, your son that is, your child that shall be.  GOBBO. I cannot think you are my son.  LAUNCELET. I know not what I shall think of that; but I am Launcelet, the Jew’s man, and I am sure Margery your wife is my mother.  GOBBO. Her name is Margery, indeed. I’ll be sworn if thou be Launcelet, thou art mine own flesh and blood. Lord worshipped might he be, what a beard hast thou got! Thou hast got more hair on thy chin than Dobbin my fill-horse has on his tail.  LAUNCELET. It should seem, then, that Dobbin’s tail grows backward. I am sure he had more hair on his tail than I have on my face when I last saw him.  GOBBO. Lord, how art thou changed! How dost thou and thy master agree? I have brought him a present. How ’gree you now?  LAUNCELET. Well, well. But for mine own part, as I have set up my rest to run away, so I will not rest till I have run some ground. My master’s a very Jew. Give him a present! Give him a halter. I am famished in his service. You may tell every finger I have with my ribs. Father, I am glad you are come, give me your present to one Master Bassanio, who indeed gives rare new liveries. If I serve not him, I will run as far as God has any ground. O rare fortune, here comes the man! To him, father; for I am a Jew, if I serve the Jew any longer.   Enter Bassanio with Leonardo and a follower or two.  BASSANIO. You may do so, but let it be so hasted that supper be ready at the farthest by five of the clock. See these letters delivered, put the liveries to making, and desire Gratiano to come anon to my lodging.   [_Exit a Servant._]  LAUNCELET. To him, father.  GOBBO. God bless your worship!  BASSANIO. Gramercy, wouldst thou aught with me?  GOBBO. Here’s my son, sir, a poor boy.  LAUNCELET. Not a poor boy, sir, but the rich Jew’s man, that would, sir, as my father shall specify.  GOBBO. He hath a great infection, sir, as one would say, to serve.  LAUNCELET. Indeed the short and the long is, I serve the Jew, and have a desire, as my father shall specify.  GOBBO. His master and he (saving your worship’s reverence) are scarce cater-cousins.  LAUNCELET. To be brief, the very truth is that the Jew, having done me wrong, doth cause me, as my father, being I hope an old man, shall frutify unto you.  GOBBO. I have here a dish of doves that I would bestow upon your worship, and my suit is—  LAUNCELET. In very brief, the suit is impertinent to myself, as your worship shall know by this honest old man, and though I say it, though old man, yet poor man, my father.  BASSANIO. One speak for both. What would you?  LAUNCELET. Serve you, sir.  GOBBO. That is the very defect of the matter, sir.  BASSANIO. I know thee well; thou hast obtain’d thy suit. Shylock thy master spoke with me this day, And hath preferr’d thee, if it be preferment To leave a rich Jew’s service to become The follower of so poor a gentleman.  LAUNCELET. The old proverb is very well parted between my master Shylock and you, sir: you have “the grace of God”, sir, and he hath “enough”.  BASSANIO. Thou speak’st it well. Go, father, with thy son. Take leave of thy old master, and inquire My lodging out. [_To a Servant._] Give him a livery More guarded than his fellows’; see it done.  LAUNCELET. Father, in. I cannot get a service, no! I have ne’er a tongue in my head! [_Looking on his palm._] Well, if any man in Italy have a fairer table which doth offer to swear upon a book, I shall have good fortune; go to, here’s a simple line of life. Here’s a small trifle of wives, alas, fifteen wives is nothing; eleven widows and nine maids is a simple coming-in for one man. And then to scape drowning thrice, and to be in peril of my life with the edge of a feather-bed; here are simple ’scapes. Well, if Fortune be a woman, she’s a good wench for this gear. Father, come; I’ll take my leave of the Jew in the twinkling.   [_Exeunt Launcelet and Old Gobbo._]  BASSANIO. I pray thee, good Leonardo, think on this. These things being bought and orderly bestow’d, Return in haste, for I do feast tonight My best esteem’d acquaintance; hie thee, go.  LEONARDO. My best endeavours shall be done herein.   Enter Gratiano.  GRATIANO. Where’s your master?  LEONARDO. Yonder, sir, he walks.   [_Exit._]  GRATIANO. Signior Bassanio!  BASSANIO. Gratiano!  GRATIANO. I have suit to you.  BASSANIO. You have obtain’d it.  GRATIANO. You must not deny me, I must go with you to Belmont.  BASSANIO. Why, then you must. But hear thee, Gratiano, Thou art too wild, too rude, and bold of voice, Parts that become thee happily enough, And in such eyes as ours appear not faults; But where thou art not known, why there they show Something too liberal. Pray thee, take pain To allay with some cold drops of modesty Thy skipping spirit, lest through thy wild behaviour I be misconst’red in the place I go to, And lose my hopes.  GRATIANO. Signior Bassanio, hear me. If I do not put on a sober habit, Talk with respect, and swear but now and then, Wear prayer-books in my pocket, look demurely, Nay more, while grace is saying, hood mine eyes Thus with my hat, and sigh, and say “amen”; Use all the observance of civility Like one well studied in a sad ostent To please his grandam, never trust me more.  BASSANIO. Well, we shall see your bearing.  GRATIANO. Nay, but I bar tonight, you shall not gauge me By what we do tonight.  BASSANIO. No, that were pity. I would entreat you rather to put on Your boldest suit of mirth, for we have friends That purpose merriment. But fare you well, I have some business.  GRATIANO. And I must to Lorenzo and the rest, But we will visit you at supper-time.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE III. The same. A room in Shylock’s house.   Enter Jessica and Launcelet.  JESSICA. I am sorry thou wilt leave my father so. Our house is hell, and thou, a merry devil, Didst rob it of some taste of tediousness. But fare thee well, there is a ducat for thee, And, Launcelet, soon at supper shalt thou see Lorenzo, who is thy new master’s guest. Give him this letter, do it secretly. And so farewell. I would not have my father See me in talk with thee.  LAUNCELET. Adieu! tears exhibit my tongue, most beautiful pagan, most sweet Jew! If a Christian do not play the knave and get thee, I am much deceived. But, adieu! These foolish drops do something drown my manly spirit. Adieu!  JESSICA. Farewell, good Launcelet.   [_Exit Launcelet._]  Alack, what heinous sin is it in me To be ashamed to be my father’s child! But though I am a daughter to his blood, I am not to his manners. O Lorenzo, If thou keep promise, I shall end this strife, Become a Christian and thy loving wife.   [_Exit._]  SCENE IV. The same. A street.   Enter Gratiano, Lorenzo, Salarino and Solanio.  LORENZO. Nay, we will slink away in supper-time, Disguise us at my lodging, and return All in an hour.  GRATIANO. We have not made good preparation.  SALARINO. We have not spoke us yet of torch-bearers.  SOLANIO. ’Tis vile, unless it may be quaintly order’d, And better in my mind not undertook.  LORENZO. ’Tis now but four o’clock, we have two hours To furnish us.   Enter Launcelet with a letter.  Friend Launcelet, what’s the news?  LAUNCELET. And it shall please you to break up this, it shall seem to signify.  LORENZO. I know the hand, in faith ’tis a fair hand, And whiter than the paper it writ on Is the fair hand that writ.  GRATIANO. Love news, in faith.  LAUNCELET. By your leave, sir.  LORENZO. Whither goest thou?  LAUNCELET. Marry, sir, to bid my old master the Jew to sup tonight with my new master the Christian.  LORENZO. Hold here, take this. Tell gentle Jessica I will not fail her, speak it privately. Go, gentlemen,   [_Exit Launcelet._]  Will you prepare you for this masque tonight? I am provided of a torch-bearer.  SALARINO. Ay, marry, I’ll be gone about it straight.  SOLANIO. And so will I.  LORENZO. Meet me and Gratiano At Gratiano’s lodging some hour hence.  SALARINO. ’Tis good we do so.   [_Exeunt Salarino and Solanio._]  GRATIANO. Was not that letter from fair Jessica?  LORENZO. I must needs tell thee all. She hath directed How I shall take her from her father’s house, What gold and jewels she is furnish’d with, What page’s suit she hath in readiness. If e’er the Jew her father come to heaven, It will be for his gentle daughter’s sake; And never dare misfortune cross her foot, Unless she do it under this excuse, That she is issue to a faithless Jew. Come, go with me, peruse this as thou goest; Fair Jessica shall be my torch-bearer.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE V. The same. Before Shylock’s house.   Enter Shylock the Jew and Launcelet his man that was the clown.  SHYLOCK. Well, thou shalt see, thy eyes shall be thy judge, The difference of old Shylock and Bassanio.— What, Jessica!—Thou shalt not gormandize As thou hast done with me;—What, Jessica!— And sleep, and snore, and rend apparel out. Why, Jessica, I say!  LAUNCELET. Why, Jessica!  SHYLOCK. Who bids thee call? I do not bid thee call.  LAUNCELET. Your worship was wont to tell me I could do nothing without bidding.   Enter Jessica.  JESSICA. Call you? What is your will?  SHYLOCK. I am bid forth to supper, Jessica. There are my keys. But wherefore should I go? I am not bid for love, they flatter me. But yet I’ll go in hate, to feed upon The prodigal Christian. Jessica, my girl, Look to my house. I am right loath to go; There is some ill a-brewing towards my rest, For I did dream of money-bags tonight.  LAUNCELET. I beseech you, sir, go. My young master doth expect your reproach.  SHYLOCK. So do I his.  LAUNCELET. And they have conspired together. I will not say you shall see a masque, but if you do, then it was not for nothing that my nose fell a-bleeding on Black Monday last at six o’clock i’ th’ morning, falling out that year on Ash-Wednesday was four year in th’ afternoon.  SHYLOCK. What, are there masques? Hear you me, Jessica, Lock up my doors, and when you hear the drum And the vile squealing of the wry-neck’d fife, Clamber not you up to the casements then, Nor thrust your head into the public street To gaze on Christian fools with varnish’d faces, But stop my house’s ears, I mean my casements. Let not the sound of shallow fopp’ry enter My sober house. By Jacob’s staff I swear I have no mind of feasting forth tonight. But I will go. Go you before me, sirrah. Say I will come.  LAUNCELET. I will go before, sir. Mistress, look out at window for all this.     There will come a Christian by     Will be worth a Jewess’ eye.   [_Exit Launcelet._]  SHYLOCK. What says that fool of Hagar’s offspring, ha?  JESSICA. His words were “Farewell, mistress,” nothing else.  SHYLOCK. The patch is kind enough, but a huge feeder, Snail-slow in profit, and he sleeps by day More than the wild-cat. Drones hive not with me, Therefore I part with him, and part with him To one that I would have him help to waste His borrowed purse. Well, Jessica, go in. Perhaps I will return immediately: Do as I bid you, shut doors after you, “Fast bind, fast find.” A proverb never stale in thrifty mind.   [_Exit._]  JESSICA. Farewell, and if my fortune be not crost, I have a father, you a daughter, lost.   [_Exit._]  SCENE VI. The same.   Enter the masquers, Gratiano and Salarino.  GRATIANO. This is the penthouse under which Lorenzo Desired us to make stand.  SALARINO. His hour is almost past.  GRATIANO. And it is marvel he out-dwells his hour, For lovers ever run before the clock.  SALARINO. O ten times faster Venus’ pigeons fly To seal love’s bonds new-made than they are wont To keep obliged faith unforfeited!  GRATIANO. That ever holds: who riseth from a feast With that keen appetite that he sits down? Where is the horse that doth untread again His tedious measures with the unbated fire That he did pace them first? All things that are, Are with more spirit chased than enjoy’d. How like a younger or a prodigal The scarfed bark puts from her native bay, Hugg’d and embraced by the strumpet wind! How like the prodigal doth she return With over-weather’d ribs and ragged sails, Lean, rent, and beggar’d by the strumpet wind!   Enter Lorenzo.  SALARINO. Here comes Lorenzo, more of this hereafter.  LORENZO. Sweet friends, your patience for my long abode. Not I but my affairs have made you wait. When you shall please to play the thieves for wives, I’ll watch as long for you then. Approach. Here dwells my father Jew. Ho! who’s within?   Enter Jessica above, in boy’s clothes.  JESSICA. Who are you? Tell me, for more certainty, Albeit I’ll swear that I do know your tongue.  LORENZO. Lorenzo, and thy love.  JESSICA. Lorenzo certain, and my love indeed, For who love I so much? And now who knows But you, Lorenzo, whether I am yours?  LORENZO. Heaven and thy thoughts are witness that thou art.  JESSICA. Here, catch this casket; it is worth the pains. I am glad ’tis night, you do not look on me, For I am much asham’d of my exchange. But love is blind, and lovers cannot see The pretty follies that themselves commit, For if they could, Cupid himself would blush To see me thus transformed to a boy.  LORENZO. Descend, for you must be my torch-bearer.  JESSICA. What! must I hold a candle to my shames? They in themselves, good sooth, are too too light. Why, ’tis an office of discovery, love, And I should be obscur’d.  LORENZO. So are you, sweet, Even in the lovely garnish of a boy. But come at once, For the close night doth play the runaway, And we are stay’d for at Bassanio’s feast.  JESSICA. I will make fast the doors, and gild myself With some moe ducats, and be with you straight.   [_Exit above._]  GRATIANO. Now, by my hood, a gentle, and no Jew.  LORENZO. Beshrew me but I love her heartily, For she is wise, if I can judge of her, And fair she is, if that mine eyes be true, And true she is, as she hath prov’d herself. And therefore, like herself, wise, fair, and true, Shall she be placed in my constant soul.   Enter Jessica.  What, art thou come? On, gentlemen, away! Our masquing mates by this time for us stay.   [_Exit with Jessica and Salarino._]   Enter Antonio.  ANTONIO. Who’s there?  GRATIANO. Signior Antonio!  ANTONIO. Fie, fie, Gratiano! where are all the rest? ’Tis nine o’clock, our friends all stay for you. No masque tonight, the wind is come about; Bassanio presently will go aboard. I have sent twenty out to seek for you.  GRATIANO. I am glad on’t. I desire no more delight Than to be under sail and gone tonight.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE VII. Belmont. A room in Portia’s house.   Flourish of cornets. Enter Portia with the Prince of Morocco and both  their trains.  PORTIA. Go, draw aside the curtains and discover The several caskets to this noble prince. Now make your choice.  PRINCE OF MOROCCO. The first, of gold, who this inscription bears, “Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.” The second, silver, which this promise carries, “Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.” This third, dull lead, with warning all as blunt, “Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.” How shall I know if I do choose the right?  PORTIA. The one of them contains my picture, prince. If you choose that, then I am yours withal.  PRINCE OF MOROCCO. Some god direct my judgment! Let me see. I will survey the inscriptions back again. What says this leaden casket? “Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.” Must give, for what? For lead? Hazard for lead! This casket threatens; men that hazard all Do it in hope of fair advantages: A golden mind stoops not to shows of dross, I’ll then nor give nor hazard aught for lead. What says the silver with her virgin hue? “Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.” As much as he deserves! Pause there, Morocco, And weigh thy value with an even hand. If thou be’st rated by thy estimation Thou dost deserve enough, and yet enough May not extend so far as to the lady. And yet to be afeard of my deserving Were but a weak disabling of myself. As much as I deserve! Why, that’s the lady: I do in birth deserve her, and in fortunes, In graces, and in qualities of breeding; But more than these, in love I do deserve. What if I stray’d no farther, but chose here? Let’s see once more this saying grav’d in gold: “Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.” Why, that’s the lady, all the world desires her. From the four corners of the earth they come To kiss this shrine, this mortal breathing saint. The Hyrcanian deserts and the vasty wilds Of wide Arabia are as throughfares now For princes to come view fair Portia. The watery kingdom, whose ambitious head Spets in the face of heaven, is no bar To stop the foreign spirits, but they come As o’er a brook to see fair Portia. One of these three contains her heavenly picture. Is’t like that lead contains her? ’Twere damnation To think so base a thought. It were too gross To rib her cerecloth in the obscure grave. Or shall I think in silver she’s immur’d Being ten times undervalued to tried gold? O sinful thought! Never so rich a gem Was set in worse than gold. They have in England A coin that bears the figure of an angel Stamped in gold; but that’s insculp’d upon; But here an angel in a golden bed Lies all within. Deliver me the key. Here do I choose, and thrive I as I may.  PORTIA. There, take it, prince, and if my form lie there, Then I am yours.   [_He unlocks the golden casket._]  PRINCE OF MOROCCO. O hell! what have we here? A carrion Death, within whose empty eye There is a written scroll. I’ll read the writing.       _All that glisters is not gold,      Often have you heard that told.      Many a man his life hath sold      But my outside to behold.      Gilded tombs do worms infold.      Had you been as wise as bold,      Young in limbs, in judgment old,      Your answer had not been inscroll’d,      Fare you well, your suit is cold._     Cold indeed and labour lost,    Then farewell heat, and welcome frost. Portia, adieu! I have too griev’d a heart To take a tedious leave. Thus losers part.   [_Exit with his train. Flourish of cornets._]  PORTIA. A gentle riddance. Draw the curtains, go. Let all of his complexion choose me so.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE VIII. Venice. A street.   Enter Salarino and Solanio.  SALARINO. Why, man, I saw Bassanio under sail; With him is Gratiano gone along; And in their ship I am sure Lorenzo is not.  SOLANIO. The villain Jew with outcries rais’d the Duke, Who went with him to search Bassanio’s ship.  SALARINO. He came too late, the ship was under sail; But there the Duke was given to understand That in a gondola were seen together Lorenzo and his amorous Jessica. Besides, Antonio certified the Duke They were not with Bassanio in his ship.  SOLANIO. I never heard a passion so confus’d, So strange, outrageous, and so variable As the dog Jew did utter in the streets. “My daughter! O my ducats! O my daughter! Fled with a Christian! O my Christian ducats! Justice! the law! my ducats and my daughter! A sealed bag, two sealed bags of ducats, Of double ducats, stol’n from me by my daughter! And jewels, two stones, two rich and precious stones, Stol’n by my daughter! Justice! find the girl, She hath the stones upon her and the ducats.”  SALARINO. Why, all the boys in Venice follow him, Crying, his stones, his daughter, and his ducats.  SOLANIO. Let good Antonio look he keep his day Or he shall pay for this.  SALARINO. Marry, well rememb’red. I reason’d with a Frenchman yesterday, Who told me, in the narrow seas that part The French and English, there miscarried A vessel of our country richly fraught. I thought upon Antonio when he told me, And wish’d in silence that it were not his.  SOLANIO. You were best to tell Antonio what you hear, Yet do not suddenly, for it may grieve him.  SALARINO. A kinder gentleman treads not the earth. I saw Bassanio and Antonio part, Bassanio told him he would make some speed Of his return. He answered “Do not so, Slubber not business for my sake, Bassanio, But stay the very riping of the time, And for the Jew’s bond which he hath of me, Let it not enter in your mind of love: Be merry, and employ your chiefest thoughts To courtship, and such fair ostents of love As shall conveniently become you there.” And even there, his eye being big with tears, Turning his face, he put his hand behind him, And with affection wondrous sensible He wrung Bassanio’s hand, and so they parted.  SOLANIO. I think he only loves the world for him. I pray thee, let us go and find him out And quicken his embraced heaviness With some delight or other.  SALARINO. Do we so.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE IX. Belmont. A room in Portia’s house.   Enter Nerissa and a Servitor.  NERISSA. Quick, quick, I pray thee, draw the curtain straight. The Prince of Arragon hath ta’en his oath, And comes to his election presently.   Flourish of cornets. Enter the Prince of Arragon, his train, and  Portia.  PORTIA. Behold, there stand the caskets, noble Prince, If you choose that wherein I am contain’d, Straight shall our nuptial rites be solemniz’d. But if you fail, without more speech, my lord, You must be gone from hence immediately.  ARRAGON. I am enjoin’d by oath to observe three things: First, never to unfold to anyone Which casket ’twas I chose; next, if I fail Of the right casket, never in my life To woo a maid in way of marriage; Lastly, If I do fail in fortune of my choice, Immediately to leave you and be gone.  PORTIA. To these injunctions everyone doth swear That comes to hazard for my worthless self.  ARRAGON. And so have I address’d me. Fortune now To my heart’s hope! Gold, silver, and base lead. “Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.” You shall look fairer ere I give or hazard. What says the golden chest? Ha! let me see: “Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.” What many men desire! that “many” may be meant By the fool multitude, that choose by show, Not learning more than the fond eye doth teach, Which pries not to th’ interior, but like the martlet Builds in the weather on the outward wall, Even in the force and road of casualty. I will not choose what many men desire, Because I will not jump with common spirits And rank me with the barbarous multitudes. Why, then to thee, thou silver treasure-house, Tell me once more what title thou dost bear. “Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.” And well said too; for who shall go about To cozen fortune, and be honourable Without the stamp of merit? Let none presume To wear an undeserved dignity. O that estates, degrees, and offices Were not deriv’d corruptly, and that clear honour Were purchas’d by the merit of the wearer! How many then should cover that stand bare? How many be commanded that command? How much low peasantry would then be gleaned From the true seed of honour? And how much honour Pick’d from the chaff and ruin of the times, To be new varnish’d? Well, but to my choice. “Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.” I will assume desert. Give me a key for this, And instantly unlock my fortunes here.   [_He opens the silver casket._]  PORTIA. Too long a pause for that which you find there.  ARRAGON. What’s here? The portrait of a blinking idiot Presenting me a schedule! I will read it. How much unlike art thou to Portia! How much unlike my hopes and my deservings! “Who chooseth me shall have as much as he deserves.” Did I deserve no more than a fool’s head? Is that my prize? Are my deserts no better?  PORTIA. To offend and judge are distinct offices, And of opposed natures.  ARRAGON. What is here?       _The fire seven times tried this;      Seven times tried that judgment is      That did never choose amiss.      Some there be that shadows kiss;      Such have but a shadow’s bliss.      There be fools alive, I wis,      Silver’d o’er, and so was this.      Take what wife you will to bed,      I will ever be your head:      So be gone; you are sped._  Still more fool I shall appear By the time I linger here. With one fool’s head I came to woo, But I go away with two. Sweet, adieu! I’ll keep my oath, Patiently to bear my wroth.   [_Exit Aragon with his train._]  PORTIA. Thus hath the candle sing’d the moth. O, these deliberate fools! When they do choose, They have the wisdom by their wit to lose.  NERISSA. The ancient saying is no heresy: Hanging and wiving goes by destiny.  PORTIA. Come, draw the curtain, Nerissa.   Enter a Messenger.  MESSENGER. Where is my lady?  PORTIA. Here, what would my lord?  MESSENGER. Madam, there is alighted at your gate A young Venetian, one that comes before To signify th’ approaching of his lord, From whom he bringeth sensible regreets; To wit (besides commends and courteous breath) Gifts of rich value; yet I have not seen So likely an ambassador of love. A day in April never came so sweet, To show how costly summer was at hand, As this fore-spurrer comes before his lord.  PORTIA. No more, I pray thee. I am half afeard Thou wilt say anon he is some kin to thee, Thou spend’st such high-day wit in praising him. Come, come, Nerissa, for I long to see Quick Cupid’s post that comes so mannerly.  NERISSA. Bassanio, Lord Love, if thy will it be!   [_Exeunt._]   ACT III  SCENE I. Venice. A street.   Enter Solanio and Salarino.  SOLANIO. Now, what news on the Rialto?  SALARINO. Why, yet it lives there unchecked that Antonio hath a ship of rich lading wrack’d on the narrow seas; the Goodwins, I think they call the place, a very dangerous flat and fatal, where the carcasses of many a tall ship lie buried, as they say, if my gossip Report be an honest woman of her word.  SOLANIO. I would she were as lying a gossip in that as ever knapped ginger or made her neighbours believe she wept for the death of a third husband. But it is true, without any slips of prolixity or crossing the plain highway of talk, that the good Antonio, the honest Antonio,—O that I had a title good enough to keep his name company!—  SALARINO. Come, the full stop.  SOLANIO. Ha, what sayest thou? Why, the end is, he hath lost a ship.  SALARINO. I would it might prove the end of his losses.  SOLANIO. Let me say “amen” betimes, lest the devil cross my prayer, for here he comes in the likeness of a Jew.   Enter Shylock.  How now, Shylock, what news among the merchants?  SHYLOCK. You knew, none so well, none so well as you, of my daughter’s flight.  SALARINO. That’s certain, I, for my part, knew the tailor that made the wings she flew withal.  SOLANIO. And Shylock, for his own part, knew the bird was fledged; and then it is the complexion of them all to leave the dam.  SHYLOCK. She is damn’d for it.  SALARINO. That’s certain, if the devil may be her judge.  SHYLOCK. My own flesh and blood to rebel!  SOLANIO. Out upon it, old carrion! Rebels it at these years?  SHYLOCK. I say my daughter is my flesh and my blood.  SALARINO. There is more difference between thy flesh and hers than between jet and ivory, more between your bloods than there is between red wine and Rhenish. But tell us, do you hear whether Antonio have had any loss at sea or no?  SHYLOCK. There I have another bad match, a bankrupt, a prodigal, who dare scarce show his head on the Rialto, a beggar that used to come so smug upon the mart; let him look to his bond. He was wont to call me usurer; let him look to his bond: he was wont to lend money for a Christian cur’sy; let him look to his bond.  SALARINO. Why, I am sure if he forfeit, thou wilt not take his flesh! What’s that good for?  SHYLOCK. To bait fish withal; if it will feed nothing else, it will feed my revenge. He hath disgrac’d me and hind’red me half a million, laugh’d at my losses, mock’d at my gains, scorned my nation, thwarted my bargains, cooled my friends, heated mine enemies. And what’s his reason? I am a Jew. Hath not a Jew eyes? Hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections, passions? Fed with the same food, hurt with the same weapons, subject to the same diseases, healed by the same means, warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer as a Christian is? If you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die? And if you wrong us, shall we not revenge? If we are like you in the rest, we will resemble you in that. If a Jew wrong a Christian, what is his humility? Revenge. If a Christian wrong a Jew, what should his sufferance be by Christian example? Why, revenge! The villainy you teach me I will execute, and it shall go hard but I will better the instruction.   Enter a man from Antonio.  SERVANT. Gentlemen, my master Antonio is at his house, and desires to speak with you both.  SALARINO. We have been up and down to seek him.   Enter Tubal.  SOLANIO. Here comes another of the tribe; a third cannot be match’d, unless the devil himself turn Jew.   [_Exeunt Solanio, Salarino and the Servant._]  SHYLOCK. How now, Tubal, what news from Genoa? Hast thou found my daughter?  TUBAL. I often came where I did hear of her, but cannot find her.  SHYLOCK. Why there, there, there, there! A diamond gone cost me two thousand ducats in Frankfort! The curse never fell upon our nation till now, I never felt it till now. Two thousand ducats in that, and other precious, precious jewels. I would my daughter were dead at my foot, and the jewels in her ear; would she were hearsed at my foot, and the ducats in her coffin. No news of them? Why so? And I know not what’s spent in the search. Why, thou—loss upon loss! The thief gone with so much, and so much to find the thief, and no satisfaction, no revenge, nor no ill luck stirring but what lights o’ my shoulders, no sighs but o’ my breathing, no tears but o’ my shedding.  TUBAL. Yes, other men have ill luck too. Antonio, as I heard in Genoa—  SHYLOCK. What, what, what? Ill luck, ill luck?  TUBAL. —hath an argosy cast away coming from Tripolis.  SHYLOCK. I thank God! I thank God! Is it true, is it true?  TUBAL. I spoke with some of the sailors that escaped the wrack.  SHYLOCK. I thank thee, good Tubal. Good news, good news! Ha, ha, heard in Genoa?  TUBAL. Your daughter spent in Genoa, as I heard, one night, fourscore ducats.  SHYLOCK. Thou stick’st a dagger in me. I shall never see my gold again. Fourscore ducats at a sitting! Fourscore ducats!  TUBAL. There came divers of Antonio’s creditors in my company to Venice that swear he cannot choose but break.  SHYLOCK. I am very glad of it. I’ll plague him, I’ll torture him. I am glad of it.  TUBAL. One of them showed me a ring that he had of your daughter for a monkey.  SHYLOCK. Out upon her! Thou torturest me, Tubal. It was my turquoise, I had it of Leah when I was a bachelor. I would not have given it for a wilderness of monkeys.  TUBAL. But Antonio is certainly undone.  SHYLOCK. Nay, that’s true, that’s very true. Go, Tubal, fee me an officer; bespeak him a fortnight before. I will have the heart of him if he forfeit, for were he out of Venice I can make what merchandise I will. Go, Tubal, and meet me at our synagogue. Go, good Tubal, at our synagogue, Tubal.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE II. Belmont. A room in Portia’s house.   Enter Bassanio, Portia, Gratiano, Nerissa and all their trains.  PORTIA. I pray you tarry, pause a day or two Before you hazard, for in choosing wrong I lose your company; therefore forbear a while. There’s something tells me (but it is not love) I would not lose you, and you know yourself Hate counsels not in such a quality. But lest you should not understand me well,— And yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought,— I would detain you here some month or two Before you venture for me. I could teach you How to choose right, but then I am forsworn. So will I never be. So may you miss me. But if you do, you’ll make me wish a sin, That I had been forsworn. Beshrew your eyes, They have o’erlook’d me and divided me. One half of me is yours, the other half yours, Mine own, I would say; but if mine, then yours, And so all yours. O these naughty times Puts bars between the owners and their rights! And so though yours, not yours. Prove it so, Let Fortune go to hell for it, not I. I speak too long, but ’tis to peise the time, To eche it, and to draw it out in length, To stay you from election.  BASSANIO. Let me choose, For as I am, I live upon the rack.  PORTIA. Upon the rack, Bassanio! Then confess What treason there is mingled with your love.  BASSANIO. None but that ugly treason of mistrust, Which makes me fear th’ enjoying of my love. There may as well be amity and life ’Tween snow and fire as treason and my love.  PORTIA. Ay, but I fear you speak upon the rack Where men enforced do speak anything.  BASSANIO. Promise me life, and I’ll confess the truth.  PORTIA. Well then, confess and live.  BASSANIO. “Confess and love” Had been the very sum of my confession: O happy torment, when my torturer Doth teach me answers for deliverance! But let me to my fortune and the caskets.  PORTIA. Away, then! I am lock’d in one of them. If you do love me, you will find me out. Nerissa and the rest, stand all aloof. Let music sound while he doth make his choice. Then if he lose he makes a swan-like end, Fading in music. That the comparison May stand more proper, my eye shall be the stream And wat’ry death-bed for him. He may win, And what is music then? Then music is Even as the flourish when true subjects bow To a new-crowned monarch. Such it is As are those dulcet sounds in break of day That creep into the dreaming bridegroom’s ear And summon him to marriage. Now he goes, With no less presence, but with much more love Than young Alcides when he did redeem The virgin tribute paid by howling Troy To the sea-monster: I stand for sacrifice; The rest aloof are the Dardanian wives, With bleared visages come forth to view The issue of th’ exploit. Go, Hercules! Live thou, I live. With much much more dismay I view the fight than thou that mak’st the fray.   A song, whilst Bassanio comments on the caskets to himself.       _Tell me where is fancy bred,      Or in the heart or in the head?      How begot, how nourished?         Reply, reply.      It is engend’red in the eyes,      With gazing fed, and fancy dies      In the cradle where it lies.         Let us all ring fancy’s knell:         I’ll begin it.—Ding, dong, bell._  ALL.      _Ding, dong, bell._  BASSANIO. So may the outward shows be least themselves. The world is still deceiv’d with ornament. In law, what plea so tainted and corrupt But, being season’d with a gracious voice, Obscures the show of evil? In religion, What damned error but some sober brow Will bless it, and approve it with a text, Hiding the grossness with fair ornament? There is no vice so simple but assumes Some mark of virtue on his outward parts. How many cowards, whose hearts are all as false As stairs of sand, wear yet upon their chins The beards of Hercules and frowning Mars, Who inward search’d, have livers white as milk, And these assume but valour’s excrement To render them redoubted. Look on beauty, And you shall see ’tis purchas’d by the weight, Which therein works a miracle in nature, Making them lightest that wear most of it: So are those crisped snaky golden locks Which make such wanton gambols with the wind Upon supposed fairness, often known To be the dowry of a second head, The skull that bred them in the sepulchre. Thus ornament is but the guiled shore To a most dangerous sea; the beauteous scarf Veiling an Indian beauty; in a word, The seeming truth which cunning times put on To entrap the wisest. Therefore thou gaudy gold, Hard food for Midas, I will none of thee, Nor none of thee, thou pale and common drudge ’Tween man and man: but thou, thou meagre lead, Which rather threaten’st than dost promise aught, Thy palenness moves me more than eloquence, And here choose I, joy be the consequence!  PORTIA. [_Aside._] How all the other passions fleet to air, As doubtful thoughts, and rash-embrac’d despair, And shudd’ring fear, and green-ey’d jealousy. O love, be moderate; allay thy ecstasy, In measure rain thy joy; scant this excess! I feel too much thy blessing, make it less, For fear I surfeit.  BASSANIO. What find I here? [_Opening the leaden casket_.] Fair Portia’s counterfeit! What demi-god Hath come so near creation? Move these eyes? Or whether, riding on the balls of mine, Seem they in motion? Here are sever’d lips, Parted with sugar breath, so sweet a bar Should sunder such sweet friends. Here in her hairs The painter plays the spider, and hath woven A golden mesh t’entrap the hearts of men Faster than gnats in cobwebs. But her eyes!— How could he see to do them? Having made one, Methinks it should have power to steal both his And leave itself unfurnish’d. Yet look how far The substance of my praise doth wrong this shadow In underprizing it, so far this shadow Doth limp behind the substance. Here’s the scroll, The continent and summary of my fortune.       _You that choose not by the view      Chance as fair and choose as true!      Since this fortune falls to you,      Be content and seek no new.      If you be well pleas’d with this,      And hold your fortune for your bliss,      Turn to where your lady is,      And claim her with a loving kiss._  A gentle scroll. Fair lady, by your leave, [_Kissing her_.] I come by note to give and to receive. Like one of two contending in a prize That thinks he hath done well in people’s eyes, Hearing applause and universal shout, Giddy in spirit, still gazing in a doubt Whether those peals of praise be his or no, So, thrice-fair lady, stand I even so, As doubtful whether what I see be true, Until confirm’d, sign’d, ratified by you.  PORTIA. You see me, Lord Bassanio, where I stand, Such as I am; though for myself alone I would not be ambitious in my wish To wish myself much better, yet for you I would be trebled twenty times myself, A thousand times more fair, ten thousand times More rich, That only to stand high in your account, I might in virtues, beauties, livings, friends, Exceed account. But the full sum of me Is sum of something, which, to term in gross, Is an unlesson’d girl, unschool’d, unpractis’d; Happy in this, she is not yet so old But she may learn; happier than this, She is not bred so dull but she can learn; Happiest of all, is that her gentle spirit Commits itself to yours to be directed, As from her lord, her governor, her king. Myself, and what is mine, to you and yours Is now converted. But now I was the lord Of this fair mansion, master of my servants, Queen o’er myself; and even now, but now, This house, these servants, and this same myself Are yours,—my lord’s. I give them with this ring, Which when you part from, lose, or give away, Let it presage the ruin of your love, And be my vantage to exclaim on you.  BASSANIO. Madam, you have bereft me of all words, Only my blood speaks to you in my veins, And there is such confusion in my powers As after some oration fairly spoke By a beloved prince, there doth appear Among the buzzing pleased multitude, Where every something being blent together, Turns to a wild of nothing, save of joy Express’d and not express’d. But when this ring Parts from this finger, then parts life from hence. O then be bold to say Bassanio’s dead!  NERISSA. My lord and lady, it is now our time, That have stood by and seen our wishes prosper, To cry, good joy. Good joy, my lord and lady!  GRATIANO. My Lord Bassanio, and my gentle lady, I wish you all the joy that you can wish; For I am sure you can wish none from me. And when your honours mean to solemnize The bargain of your faith, I do beseech you Even at that time I may be married too.  BASSANIO. With all my heart, so thou canst get a wife.  GRATIANO. I thank your lordship, you have got me one. My eyes, my lord, can look as swift as yours: You saw the mistress, I beheld the maid. You lov’d, I lov’d; for intermission No more pertains to me, my lord, than you. Your fortune stood upon the caskets there, And so did mine too, as the matter falls. For wooing here until I sweat again, And swearing till my very roof was dry With oaths of love, at last, (if promise last) I got a promise of this fair one here To have her love, provided that your fortune Achiev’d her mistress.  PORTIA. Is this true, Nerissa?  NERISSA. Madam, it is, so you stand pleas’d withal.  BASSANIO. And do you, Gratiano, mean good faith?  GRATIANO. Yes, faith, my lord.  BASSANIO. Our feast shall be much honoured in your marriage.  GRATIANO. We’ll play with them the first boy for a thousand ducats.  NERISSA. What! and stake down?  GRATIANO. No, we shall ne’er win at that sport and stake down. But who comes here? Lorenzo and his infidel? What, and my old Venetian friend, Salerio!   Enter Lorenzo, Jessica and Salerio.  BASSANIO. Lorenzo and Salerio, welcome hither, If that the youth of my new int’rest here Have power to bid you welcome. By your leave, I bid my very friends and countrymen, Sweet Portia, welcome.  PORTIA. So do I, my lord, They are entirely welcome.  LORENZO. I thank your honour. For my part, my lord, My purpose was not to have seen you here, But meeting with Salerio by the way, He did entreat me, past all saying nay, To come with him along.  SALERIO. I did, my lord, And I have reason for it. Signior Antonio Commends him to you.   [_Gives Bassanio a letter._]  BASSANIO. Ere I ope his letter, I pray you tell me how my good friend doth.  SALERIO. Not sick, my lord, unless it be in mind, Nor well, unless in mind. His letter there Will show you his estate.   [_Bassanio opens the letter._]  GRATIANO. Nerissa, cheer yond stranger, bid her welcome. Your hand, Salerio. What’s the news from Venice? How doth that royal merchant, good Antonio? I know he will be glad of our success. We are the Jasons, we have won the fleece.  SALERIO. I would you had won the fleece that he hath lost.  PORTIA. There are some shrewd contents in yond same paper That steals the colour from Bassanio’s cheek. Some dear friend dead, else nothing in the world Could turn so much the constitution Of any constant man. What, worse and worse? With leave, Bassanio, I am half yourself, And I must freely have the half of anything That this same paper brings you.  BASSANIO. O sweet Portia, Here are a few of the unpleasant’st words That ever blotted paper. Gentle lady, When I did first impart my love to you, I freely told you all the wealth I had Ran in my veins, I was a gentleman. And then I told you true. And yet, dear lady, Rating myself at nothing, you shall see How much I was a braggart. When I told you My state was nothing, I should then have told you That I was worse than nothing; for indeed I have engag’d myself to a dear friend, Engag’d my friend to his mere enemy, To feed my means. Here is a letter, lady, The paper as the body of my friend, And every word in it a gaping wound Issuing life-blood. But is it true, Salerio? Hath all his ventures fail’d? What, not one hit? From Tripolis, from Mexico, and England, From Lisbon, Barbary, and India, And not one vessel scape the dreadful touch Of merchant-marring rocks?  SALERIO. Not one, my lord. Besides, it should appear, that if he had The present money to discharge the Jew, He would not take it. Never did I know A creature that did bear the shape of man So keen and greedy to confound a man. He plies the Duke at morning and at night, And doth impeach the freedom of the state If they deny him justice. Twenty merchants, The Duke himself, and the magnificoes Of greatest port have all persuaded with him, But none can drive him from the envious plea Of forfeiture, of justice, and his bond.  JESSICA. When I was with him, I have heard him swear To Tubal and to Chus, his countrymen, That he would rather have Antonio’s flesh Than twenty times the value of the sum That he did owe him. And I know, my lord, If law, authority, and power deny not, It will go hard with poor Antonio.  PORTIA. Is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble?  BASSANIO. The dearest friend to me, the kindest man, The best condition’d and unwearied spirit In doing courtesies, and one in whom The ancient Roman honour more appears Than any that draws breath in Italy.  PORTIA. What sum owes he the Jew?  BASSANIO. For me three thousand ducats.  PORTIA. What, no more? Pay him six thousand, and deface the bond. Double six thousand, and then treble that, Before a friend of this description Shall lose a hair through Bassanio’s fault. First go with me to church and call me wife, And then away to Venice to your friend. For never shall you lie by Portia’s side With an unquiet soul. You shall have gold To pay the petty debt twenty times over. When it is paid, bring your true friend along. My maid Nerissa and myself meantime, Will live as maids and widows. Come, away! For you shall hence upon your wedding day. Bid your friends welcome, show a merry cheer; Since you are dear bought, I will love you dear. But let me hear the letter of your friend.  BASSANIO. _Sweet Bassanio, my ships have all miscarried, my creditors grow cruel, my estate is very low, my bond to the Jew is forfeit, and since in paying it, it is impossible I should live, all debts are clear’d between you and I, if I might but see you at my death. Notwithstanding, use your pleasure. If your love do not persuade you to come, let not my letter._  PORTIA. O love, dispatch all business and be gone!  BASSANIO. Since I have your good leave to go away, I will make haste; but, till I come again, No bed shall e’er be guilty of my stay, Nor rest be interposer ’twixt us twain.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE III. Venice. A street.   Enter Shylock, Salarino, Antonio and Gaoler.  SHYLOCK. Gaoler, look to him. Tell not me of mercy. This is the fool that lent out money gratis. Gaoler, look to him.  ANTONIO. Hear me yet, good Shylock.  SHYLOCK. I’ll have my bond, speak not against my bond. I have sworn an oath that I will have my bond. Thou call’dst me dog before thou hadst a cause, But since I am a dog, beware my fangs; The Duke shall grant me justice. I do wonder, Thou naughty gaoler, that thou art so fond To come abroad with him at his request.  ANTONIO. I pray thee hear me speak.  SHYLOCK. I’ll have my bond. I will not hear thee speak. I’ll have my bond, and therefore speak no more. I’ll not be made a soft and dull-eyed fool, To shake the head, relent, and sigh, and yield To Christian intercessors. Follow not, I’ll have no speaking, I will have my bond.   [_Exit._]  SALARINO. It is the most impenetrable cur That ever kept with men.  ANTONIO. Let him alone. I’ll follow him no more with bootless prayers. He seeks my life, his reason well I know: I oft deliver’d from his forfeitures Many that have at times made moan to me. Therefore he hates me.  SALARINO. I am sure the Duke Will never grant this forfeiture to hold.  ANTONIO. The Duke cannot deny the course of law, For the commodity that strangers have With us in Venice, if it be denied, ’Twill much impeach the justice of the state, Since that the trade and profit of the city Consisteth of all nations. Therefore, go. These griefs and losses have so bated me That I shall hardly spare a pound of flesh Tomorrow to my bloody creditor. Well, gaoler, on, pray God Bassanio come To see me pay his debt, and then I care not.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE IV. Belmont. A room in Portia’s house.   Enter Portia, Nerissa, Lorenzo, Jessica and Balthazar.  LORENZO. Madam, although I speak it in your presence, You have a noble and a true conceit Of godlike amity, which appears most strongly In bearing thus the absence of your lord. But if you knew to whom you show this honour, How true a gentleman you send relief, How dear a lover of my lord your husband, I know you would be prouder of the work Than customary bounty can enforce you.  PORTIA. I never did repent for doing good, Nor shall not now; for in companions That do converse and waste the time together, Whose souls do bear an equal yoke of love, There must be needs a like proportion Of lineaments, of manners, and of spirit; Which makes me think that this Antonio, Being the bosom lover of my lord, Must needs be like my lord. If it be so, How little is the cost I have bestowed In purchasing the semblance of my soul From out the state of hellish cruelty! This comes too near the praising of myself; Therefore no more of it. Hear other things. Lorenzo, I commit into your hands The husbandry and manage of my house Until my lord’s return. For mine own part, I have toward heaven breath’d a secret vow To live in prayer and contemplation, Only attended by Nerissa here, Until her husband and my lord’s return. There is a monastery two miles off, And there we will abide. I do desire you Not to deny this imposition, The which my love and some necessity Now lays upon you.  LORENZO. Madam, with all my heart I shall obey you in all fair commands.  PORTIA. My people do already know my mind, And will acknowledge you and Jessica In place of Lord Bassanio and myself. So fare you well till we shall meet again.  LORENZO. Fair thoughts and happy hours attend on you!  JESSICA. I wish your ladyship all heart’s content.  PORTIA. I thank you for your wish, and am well pleas’d To wish it back on you. Fare you well, Jessica.   [_Exeunt Jessica and Lorenzo._]  Now, Balthazar, As I have ever found thee honest-true, So let me find thee still. Take this same letter, And use thou all th’ endeavour of a man In speed to Padua, see thou render this Into my cousin’s hands, Doctor Bellario; And look what notes and garments he doth give thee, Bring them, I pray thee, with imagin’d speed Unto the traject, to the common ferry Which trades to Venice. Waste no time in words, But get thee gone. I shall be there before thee.  BALTHAZAR. Madam, I go with all convenient speed.   [_Exit._]  PORTIA. Come on, Nerissa, I have work in hand That you yet know not of; we’ll see our husbands Before they think of us.  NERISSA. Shall they see us?  PORTIA. They shall, Nerissa, but in such a habit That they shall think we are accomplished With that we lack. I’ll hold thee any wager, When we are both accoutered like young men, I’ll prove the prettier fellow of the two, And wear my dagger with the braver grace, And speak between the change of man and boy With a reed voice; and turn two mincing steps Into a manly stride; and speak of frays Like a fine bragging youth; and tell quaint lies How honourable ladies sought my love, Which I denying, they fell sick and died; I could not do withal. Then I’ll repent, And wish for all that, that I had not kill’d them. And twenty of these puny lies I’ll tell, That men shall swear I have discontinued school About a twelvemonth. I have within my mind A thousand raw tricks of these bragging Jacks, Which I will practise.  NERISSA. Why, shall we turn to men?  PORTIA. Fie, what a question’s that, If thou wert near a lewd interpreter! But come, I’ll tell thee all my whole device When I am in my coach, which stays for us At the park gate; and therefore haste away, For we must measure twenty miles today.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE V. The same. A garden.   Enter Launcelet and Jessica.  LAUNCELET. Yes, truly, for look you, the sins of the father are to be laid upon the children, therefore, I promise you, I fear you. I was always plain with you, and so now I speak my agitation of the matter. Therefore be of good cheer, for truly I think you are damn’d. There is but one hope in it that can do you any good, and that is but a kind of bastard hope neither.  JESSICA. And what hope is that, I pray thee?  LAUNCELET. Marry, you may partly hope that your father got you not, that you are not the Jew’s daughter.  JESSICA. That were a kind of bastard hope indeed; so the sins of my mother should be visited upon me.  LAUNCELET. Truly then I fear you are damn’d both by father and mother; thus when I shun Scylla your father, I fall into Charybdis your mother. Well, you are gone both ways.  JESSICA. I shall be saved by my husband. He hath made me a Christian.  LAUNCELET. Truly the more to blame he, we were Christians enow before, e’en as many as could well live one by another. This making of Christians will raise the price of hogs; if we grow all to be pork-eaters, we shall not shortly have a rasher on the coals for money.   Enter Lorenzo.  JESSICA. I’ll tell my husband, Launcelet, what you say. Here he comes.  LORENZO. I shall grow jealous of you shortly, Launcelet, if you thus get my wife into corners!  JESSICA. Nay, you need nor fear us, Lorenzo. Launcelet and I are out. He tells me flatly there’s no mercy for me in heaven, because I am a Jew’s daughter; and he says you are no good member of the commonwealth, for in converting Jews to Christians you raise the price of pork.  LORENZO. I shall answer that better to the commonwealth than you can the getting up of the negro’s belly! The Moor is with child by you, Launcelet.  LAUNCELET. It is much that the Moor should be more than reason; but if she be less than an honest woman, she is indeed more than I took her for.  LORENZO. How every fool can play upon the word! I think the best grace of wit will shortly turn into silence, and discourse grow commendable in none only but parrots. Go in, sirrah; bid them prepare for dinner.  LAUNCELET. That is done, sir, they have all stomachs.  LORENZO. Goodly Lord, what a wit-snapper are you! Then bid them prepare dinner.  LAUNCELET. That is done too, sir, only “cover” is the word.  LORENZO. Will you cover, then, sir?  LAUNCELET. Not so, sir, neither. I know my duty.  LORENZO. Yet more quarrelling with occasion! Wilt thou show the whole wealth of thy wit in an instant? I pray thee understand a plain man in his plain meaning: go to thy fellows, bid them cover the table, serve in the meat, and we will come in to dinner.  LAUNCELET. For the table, sir, it shall be served in; for the meat, sir, it shall be covered; for your coming in to dinner, sir, why, let it be as humours and conceits shall govern.   [_Exit._]  LORENZO. O dear discretion, how his words are suited! The fool hath planted in his memory An army of good words, and I do know A many fools that stand in better place, Garnish’d like him, that for a tricksy word Defy the matter. How cheer’st thou, Jessica? And now, good sweet, say thy opinion, How dost thou like the Lord Bassanio’s wife?  JESSICA. Past all expressing. It is very meet The Lord Bassanio live an upright life, For having such a blessing in his lady, He finds the joys of heaven here on earth, And if on earth he do not merit it, In reason he should never come to heaven. Why, if two gods should play some heavenly match, And on the wager lay two earthly women, And Portia one, there must be something else Pawn’d with the other, for the poor rude world Hath not her fellow.  LORENZO. Even such a husband Hast thou of me as she is for a wife.  JESSICA. Nay, but ask my opinion too of that.  LORENZO. I will anon. First let us go to dinner.  JESSICA. Nay, let me praise you while I have a stomach.  LORENZO. No pray thee, let it serve for table-talk. Then howsome’er thou speak’st, ’mong other things I shall digest it.  JESSICA. Well, I’ll set you forth.   [_Exeunt._]   ACT IV  SCENE I. Venice. A court of justice.   Enter the Duke, the Magnificoes, Antonio, Bassanio, Gratiano, Salerio  and others.  DUKE. What, is Antonio here?  ANTONIO. Ready, so please your Grace.  DUKE. I am sorry for thee, thou art come to answer A stony adversary, an inhuman wretch, Uncapable of pity, void and empty From any dram of mercy.  ANTONIO. I have heard Your Grace hath ta’en great pains to qualify His rigorous course; but since he stands obdurate, And that no lawful means can carry me Out of his envy’s reach, I do oppose My patience to his fury, and am arm’d To suffer with a quietness of spirit The very tyranny and rage of his.  DUKE. Go one and call the Jew into the court.  SALARINO. He is ready at the door. He comes, my lord.   Enter Shylock.  DUKE. Make room, and let him stand before our face. Shylock, the world thinks, and I think so too, That thou but leadest this fashion of thy malice To the last hour of act, and then, ’tis thought, Thou’lt show thy mercy and remorse more strange Than is thy strange apparent cruelty; And where thou now exacts the penalty, Which is a pound of this poor merchant’s flesh, Thou wilt not only loose the forfeiture, But, touch’d with human gentleness and love, Forgive a moiety of the principal, Glancing an eye of pity on his losses That have of late so huddled on his back, Enow to press a royal merchant down, And pluck commiseration of his state From brassy bosoms and rough hearts of flint, From stubborn Turks and Tartars never train’d To offices of tender courtesy. We all expect a gentle answer, Jew.  SHYLOCK. I have possess’d your Grace of what I purpose, And by our holy Sabbath have I sworn To have the due and forfeit of my bond. If you deny it, let the danger light Upon your charter and your city’s freedom! You’ll ask me why I rather choose to have A weight of carrion flesh than to receive Three thousand ducats. I’ll not answer that, But say it is my humour. Is it answer’d? What if my house be troubled with a rat, And I be pleas’d to give ten thousand ducats To have it ban’d? What, are you answer’d yet? Some men there are love not a gaping pig; Some that are mad if they behold a cat; And others, when the bagpipe sings i’ the nose, Cannot contain their urine; for affection Mistress of passion, sways it to the mood Of what it likes or loathes. Now, for your answer: As there is no firm reason to be render’d Why he cannot abide a gaping pig, Why he a harmless necessary cat, Why he a woollen bagpipe, but of force Must yield to such inevitable shame As to offend, himself being offended, So can I give no reason, nor I will not, More than a lodg’d hate and a certain loathing I bear Antonio, that I follow thus A losing suit against him. Are you answered?  BASSANIO. This is no answer, thou unfeeling man, To excuse the current of thy cruelty.  SHYLOCK. I am not bound to please thee with my answer.  BASSANIO. Do all men kill the things they do not love?  SHYLOCK. Hates any man the thing he would not kill?  BASSANIO. Every offence is not a hate at first.  SHYLOCK. What, wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice?  ANTONIO. I pray you, think you question with the Jew. You may as well go stand upon the beach And bid the main flood bate his usual height; You may as well use question with the wolf, Why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb; You may as well forbid the mountain pines To wag their high tops and to make no noise When they are fretten with the gusts of heaven; You may as well do anything most hard As seek to soften that—than which what’s harder?— His Jewish heart. Therefore, I do beseech you, Make no moe offers, use no farther means, But with all brief and plain conveniency. Let me have judgment, and the Jew his will.  BASSANIO. For thy three thousand ducats here is six.  SHYLOCK. If every ducat in six thousand ducats Were in six parts, and every part a ducat, I would not draw them, I would have my bond.  DUKE. How shalt thou hope for mercy, rend’ring none?  SHYLOCK. What judgment shall I dread, doing no wrong? You have among you many a purchas’d slave, Which, like your asses and your dogs and mules, You use in abject and in slavish parts, Because you bought them. Shall I say to you “Let them be free, marry them to your heirs? Why sweat they under burdens? Let their beds Be made as soft as yours, and let their palates Be season’d with such viands”? You will answer “The slaves are ours.” So do I answer you: The pound of flesh which I demand of him Is dearly bought; ’tis mine and I will have it. If you deny me, fie upon your law! There is no force in the decrees of Venice. I stand for judgment. Answer; shall I have it?  DUKE. Upon my power I may dismiss this court, Unless Bellario, a learned doctor, Whom I have sent for to determine this, Come here today.  SALARINO. My lord, here stays without A messenger with letters from the doctor, New come from Padua.  DUKE. Bring us the letters. Call the messenger.  BASSANIO. Good cheer, Antonio! What, man, courage yet! The Jew shall have my flesh, blood, bones, and all, Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood.  ANTONIO. I am a tainted wether of the flock, Meetest for death, the weakest kind of fruit Drops earliest to the ground, and so let me. You cannot better be employ’d, Bassanio, Than to live still, and write mine epitaph.   Enter Nerissa dressed like a lawyer’s clerk.  DUKE. Came you from Padua, from Bellario?  NERISSA. From both, my lord. Bellario greets your Grace.   [_Presents a letter._]  BASSANIO. Why dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly?  SHYLOCK. To cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there.  GRATIANO. Not on thy sole but on thy soul, harsh Jew, Thou mak’st thy knife keen. But no metal can, No, not the hangman’s axe, bear half the keenness Of thy sharp envy. Can no prayers pierce thee?  SHYLOCK. No, none that thou hast wit enough to make.  GRATIANO. O, be thou damn’d, inexecrable dog! And for thy life let justice be accus’d; Thou almost mak’st me waver in my faith, To hold opinion with Pythagoras That souls of animals infuse themselves Into the trunks of men. Thy currish spirit Govern’d a wolf who, hang’d for human slaughter, Even from the gallows did his fell soul fleet, And whilst thou layest in thy unhallowed dam, Infus’d itself in thee; for thy desires Are wolfish, bloody, starv’d and ravenous.  SHYLOCK. Till thou canst rail the seal from off my bond, Thou but offend’st thy lungs to speak so loud. Repair thy wit, good youth, or it will fall To cureless ruin. I stand here for law.  DUKE. This letter from Bellario doth commend A young and learned doctor to our court. Where is he?  NERISSA. He attendeth here hard by, To know your answer, whether you’ll admit him.  DUKE OF VENICE. With all my heart: some three or four of you Go give him courteous conduct to this place. Meantime, the court shall hear Bellario’s letter.  [_Reads._] _Your Grace shall understand that at the receipt of your letter I am very sick, but in the instant that your messenger came, in loving visitation was with me a young doctor of Rome. His name is Balthazar. I acquainted him with the cause in controversy between the Jew and Antonio the merchant. We turn’d o’er many books together. He is furnished with my opinion, which, bettered with his own learning (the greatness whereof I cannot enough commend), comes with him at my importunity to fill up your Grace’s request in my stead. I beseech you let his lack of years be no impediment to let him lack a reverend estimation, for I never knew so young a body with so old a head. I leave him to your gracious acceptance, whose trial shall better publish his commendation._  You hear the learn’d Bellario what he writes, And here, I take it, is the doctor come.   Enter Portia dressed like a doctor of laws.  Give me your hand. Come you from old Bellario?  PORTIA. I did, my lord.  DUKE. You are welcome. Take your place. Are you acquainted with the difference That holds this present question in the court?  PORTIA. I am informed throughly of the cause. Which is the merchant here? And which the Jew?  DUKE. Antonio and old Shylock, both stand forth.  PORTIA. Is your name Shylock?  SHYLOCK. Shylock is my name.  PORTIA. Of a strange nature is the suit you follow, Yet in such rule that the Venetian law Cannot impugn you as you do proceed. [_To Antonio_.] You stand within his danger, do you not?  ANTONIO. Ay, so he says.  PORTIA. Do you confess the bond?  ANTONIO. I do.  PORTIA. Then must the Jew be merciful.  SHYLOCK. On what compulsion must I? Tell me that.  PORTIA. The quality of mercy is not strain’d, It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven Upon the place beneath. It is twice blest, It blesseth him that gives and him that takes. ’Tis mightiest in the mightiest; it becomes The throned monarch better than his crown. His sceptre shows the force of temporal power, The attribute to awe and majesty, Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings; But mercy is above this sceptred sway, It is enthroned in the hearts of kings, It is an attribute to God himself; And earthly power doth then show likest God’s When mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew, Though justice be thy plea, consider this, That in the course of justice none of us Should see salvation. We do pray for mercy, And that same prayer doth teach us all to render The deeds of mercy. I have spoke thus much To mitigate the justice of thy plea, Which if thou follow, this strict court of Venice Must needs give sentence ’gainst the merchant there.  SHYLOCK. My deeds upon my head! I crave the law, The penalty and forfeit of my bond.  PORTIA. Is he not able to discharge the money?  BASSANIO. Yes, here I tender it for him in the court, Yea, twice the sum, if that will not suffice, I will be bound to pay it ten times o’er On forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart. If this will not suffice, it must appear That malice bears down truth. And I beseech you, Wrest once the law to your authority. To do a great right, do a little wrong, And curb this cruel devil of his will.  PORTIA. It must not be, there is no power in Venice Can alter a decree established; ’Twill be recorded for a precedent, And many an error by the same example Will rush into the state. It cannot be.  SHYLOCK. A Daniel come to judgment! Yea, a Daniel! O wise young judge, how I do honour thee!  PORTIA. I pray you let me look upon the bond.  SHYLOCK. Here ’tis, most reverend doctor, here it is.  PORTIA. Shylock, there’s thrice thy money offered thee.  SHYLOCK. An oath, an oath! I have an oath in heaven. Shall I lay perjury upon my soul? No, not for Venice.  PORTIA. Why, this bond is forfeit, And lawfully by this the Jew may claim A pound of flesh, to be by him cut off Nearest the merchant’s heart. Be merciful, Take thrice thy money; bid me tear the bond.  SHYLOCK. When it is paid according to the tenour. It doth appear you are a worthy judge; You know the law; your exposition Hath been most sound. I charge you by the law, Whereof you are a well-deserving pillar, Proceed to judgment. By my soul I swear There is no power in the tongue of man To alter me. I stay here on my bond.  ANTONIO. Most heartily I do beseech the court To give the judgment.  PORTIA. Why then, thus it is: You must prepare your bosom for his knife.  SHYLOCK. O noble judge! O excellent young man!  PORTIA. For the intent and purpose of the law Hath full relation to the penalty, Which here appeareth due upon the bond.  SHYLOCK. ’Tis very true. O wise and upright judge, How much more elder art thou than thy looks!  PORTIA. Therefore lay bare your bosom.  SHYLOCK. Ay, his breast So says the bond, doth it not, noble judge? “Nearest his heart”: those are the very words.  PORTIA. It is so. Are there balance here to weigh The flesh?  SHYLOCK. I have them ready.  PORTIA. Have by some surgeon, Shylock, on your charge, To stop his wounds, lest he do bleed to death.  SHYLOCK. Is it so nominated in the bond?  PORTIA. It is not so express’d, but what of that? ’Twere good you do so much for charity.  SHYLOCK. I cannot find it; ’tis not in the bond.  PORTIA. You, merchant, have you anything to say?  ANTONIO. But little. I am arm’d and well prepar’d. Give me your hand, Bassanio. Fare you well, Grieve not that I am fallen to this for you, For herein Fortune shows herself more kind Than is her custom: it is still her use To let the wretched man outlive his wealth, To view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow An age of poverty, from which ling’ring penance Of such misery doth she cut me off. Commend me to your honourable wife, Tell her the process of Antonio’s end, Say how I lov’d you, speak me fair in death. And when the tale is told, bid her be judge Whether Bassanio had not once a love. Repent but you that you shall lose your friend And he repents not that he pays your debt. For if the Jew do cut but deep enough, I’ll pay it instantly with all my heart.  BASSANIO. Antonio, I am married to a wife Which is as dear to me as life itself, But life itself, my wife, and all the world, Are not with me esteem’d above thy life. I would lose all, ay, sacrifice them all Here to this devil, to deliver you.  PORTIA. Your wife would give you little thanks for that If she were by to hear you make the offer.  GRATIANO. I have a wife who I protest I love. I would she were in heaven, so she could Entreat some power to change this currish Jew.  NERISSA. ’Tis well you offer it behind her back, The wish would make else an unquiet house.  SHYLOCK. These be the Christian husbands! I have a daughter— Would any of the stock of Barabbas Had been her husband, rather than a Christian! We trifle time, I pray thee, pursue sentence.  PORTIA. A pound of that same merchant’s flesh is thine, The court awards it and the law doth give it.  SHYLOCK. Most rightful judge!  PORTIA. And you must cut this flesh from off his breast. The law allows it and the court awards it.  SHYLOCK. Most learned judge! A sentence! Come, prepare.  PORTIA. Tarry a little, there is something else. This bond doth give thee here no jot of blood. The words expressly are “a pound of flesh”: Take then thy bond, take thou thy pound of flesh, But in the cutting it, if thou dost shed One drop of Christian blood, thy lands and goods Are, by the laws of Venice, confiscate Unto the state of Venice.  GRATIANO. O upright judge! Mark, Jew. O learned judge!  SHYLOCK. Is that the law?  PORTIA. Thyself shalt see the act. For, as thou urgest justice, be assur’d Thou shalt have justice more than thou desir’st.  GRATIANO. O learned judge! Mark, Jew, a learned judge!  SHYLOCK. I take this offer then. Pay the bond thrice And let the Christian go.  BASSANIO. Here is the money.  PORTIA. Soft! The Jew shall have all justice. Soft! no haste! He shall have nothing but the penalty.  GRATIANO. O Jew, an upright judge, a learned judge!  PORTIA. Therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh. Shed thou no blood, nor cut thou less nor more, But just a pound of flesh: if thou tak’st more Or less than a just pound, be it but so much As makes it light or heavy in the substance, Or the division of the twentieth part Of one poor scruple, nay, if the scale do turn But in the estimation of a hair, Thou diest, and all thy goods are confiscate.  GRATIANO. A second Daniel, a Daniel, Jew! Now, infidel, I have you on the hip.  PORTIA. Why doth the Jew pause? Take thy forfeiture.  SHYLOCK. Give me my principal, and let me go.  BASSANIO. I have it ready for thee. Here it is.  PORTIA. He hath refus’d it in the open court, He shall have merely justice and his bond.  GRATIANO. A Daniel still say I, a second Daniel! I thank thee, Jew, for teaching me that word.  SHYLOCK. Shall I not have barely my principal?  PORTIA. Thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture To be so taken at thy peril, Jew.  SHYLOCK. Why, then the devil give him good of it! I’ll stay no longer question.  PORTIA. Tarry, Jew. The law hath yet another hold on you. It is enacted in the laws of Venice, If it be proved against an alien That by direct or indirect attempts He seek the life of any citizen, The party ’gainst the which he doth contrive Shall seize one half his goods; the other half Comes to the privy coffer of the state, And the offender’s life lies in the mercy Of the Duke only, ’gainst all other voice. In which predicament I say thou stand’st; For it appears by manifest proceeding That indirectly, and directly too, Thou hast contrived against the very life Of the defendant; and thou hast incurr’d The danger formerly by me rehears’d. Down, therefore, and beg mercy of the Duke.  GRATIANO. Beg that thou mayst have leave to hang thyself, And yet, thy wealth being forfeit to the state, Thou hast not left the value of a cord; Therefore thou must be hang’d at the state’s charge.  DUKE. That thou shalt see the difference of our spirit, I pardon thee thy life before thou ask it. For half thy wealth, it is Antonio’s; The other half comes to the general state, Which humbleness may drive unto a fine.  PORTIA. Ay, for the state, not for Antonio.  SHYLOCK. Nay, take my life and all, pardon not that. You take my house when you do take the prop That doth sustain my house; you take my life When you do take the means whereby I live.  PORTIA. What mercy can you render him, Antonio?  GRATIANO. A halter gratis, nothing else, for God’s sake!  ANTONIO. So please my lord the Duke and all the court To quit the fine for one half of his goods, I am content, so he will let me have The other half in use, to render it Upon his death unto the gentleman That lately stole his daughter. Two things provided more, that for this favour, He presently become a Christian; The other, that he do record a gift, Here in the court, of all he dies possess’d Unto his son Lorenzo and his daughter.  DUKE. He shall do this, or else I do recant The pardon that I late pronounced here.  PORTIA. Art thou contented, Jew? What dost thou say?  SHYLOCK. I am content.  PORTIA. Clerk, draw a deed of gift.  SHYLOCK. I pray you give me leave to go from hence; I am not well; send the deed after me And I will sign it.  DUKE. Get thee gone, but do it.  GRATIANO. In christ’ning shalt thou have two god-fathers. Had I been judge, thou shouldst have had ten more, To bring thee to the gallows, not to the font.   [_Exit Shylock._]  DUKE. Sir, I entreat you home with me to dinner.  PORTIA. I humbly do desire your Grace of pardon, I must away this night toward Padua, And it is meet I presently set forth.  DUKE. I am sorry that your leisure serves you not. Antonio, gratify this gentleman, For in my mind you are much bound to him.   [_Exeunt Duke and his train._]  BASSANIO. Most worthy gentleman, I and my friend Have by your wisdom been this day acquitted Of grievous penalties, in lieu whereof, Three thousand ducats due unto the Jew We freely cope your courteous pains withal.  ANTONIO. And stand indebted, over and above In love and service to you evermore.  PORTIA. He is well paid that is well satisfied, And I delivering you, am satisfied, And therein do account myself well paid, My mind was never yet more mercenary. I pray you know me when we meet again, I wish you well, and so I take my leave.  BASSANIO. Dear sir, of force I must attempt you further. Take some remembrance of us as a tribute, Not as fee. Grant me two things, I pray you, Not to deny me, and to pardon me.  PORTIA. You press me far, and therefore I will yield. [_To Antonio_.] Give me your gloves, I’ll wear them for your sake. [_To Bassanio_.] And, for your love, I’ll take this ring from you. Do not draw back your hand; I’ll take no more, And you in love shall not deny me this.  BASSANIO. This ring, good sir? Alas, it is a trifle, I will not shame myself to give you this.  PORTIA. I will have nothing else but only this, And now methinks I have a mind to it.  BASSANIO. There’s more depends on this than on the value. The dearest ring in Venice will I give you, And find it out by proclamation, Only for this I pray you pardon me.  PORTIA. I see, sir, you are liberal in offers. You taught me first to beg, and now methinks You teach me how a beggar should be answer’d.  BASSANIO. Good sir, this ring was given me by my wife, And when she put it on, she made me vow That I should neither sell, nor give, nor lose it.  PORTIA. That ’scuse serves many men to save their gifts. And if your wife be not a mad-woman, And know how well I have deserv’d this ring, She would not hold out enemy for ever For giving it to me. Well, peace be with you!   [_Exeunt Portia and Nerissa._]  ANTONIO. My Lord Bassanio, let him have the ring. Let his deservings and my love withal Be valued ’gainst your wife’s commandment.  BASSANIO. Go, Gratiano, run and overtake him; Give him the ring, and bring him if thou canst Unto Antonio’s house. Away, make haste.   [_Exit Gratiano._]  Come, you and I will thither presently, And in the morning early will we both Fly toward Belmont. Come, Antonio.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE II. The same. A street.   Enter Portia and Nerissa.  PORTIA. Inquire the Jew’s house out, give him this deed, And let him sign it, we’ll away tonight, And be a day before our husbands home. This deed will be well welcome to Lorenzo.   Enter Gratiano.  GRATIANO. Fair sir, you are well o’erta’en. My Lord Bassanio upon more advice, Hath sent you here this ring, and doth entreat Your company at dinner.  PORTIA. That cannot be; His ring I do accept most thankfully, And so I pray you tell him. Furthermore, I pray you show my youth old Shylock’s house.  GRATIANO. That will I do.  NERISSA. Sir, I would speak with you. [_Aside to Portia_.] I’ll see if I can get my husband’s ring, Which I did make him swear to keep for ever.  PORTIA. [_To Nerissa_.] Thou mayst, I warrant. We shall have old swearing That they did give the rings away to men; But we’ll outface them, and outswear them too. Away! make haste! Thou know’st where I will tarry.  NERISSA. Come, good sir, will you show me to this house?   [_Exeunt._]   ACT V  SCENE I. Belmont. The avenue to Portia’s house.   Enter Lorenzo and Jessica.  LORENZO. The moon shines bright. In such a night as this, When the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees, And they did make no noise, in such a night, Troilus methinks mounted the Trojan walls, And sigh’d his soul toward the Grecian tents Where Cressid lay that night.  JESSICA. In such a night Did Thisby fearfully o’ertrip the dew, And saw the lion’s shadow ere himself, And ran dismay’d away.  LORENZO. In such a night Stood Dido with a willow in her hand Upon the wild sea-banks, and waft her love To come again to Carthage.  JESSICA. In such a night Medea gathered the enchanted herbs That did renew old Æson.  LORENZO. In such a night Did Jessica steal from the wealthy Jew, And with an unthrift love did run from Venice As far as Belmont.  JESSICA. In such a night Did young Lorenzo swear he loved her well, Stealing her soul with many vows of faith, And ne’er a true one.  LORENZO. In such a night Did pretty Jessica, like a little shrew, Slander her love, and he forgave it her.  JESSICA. I would out-night you did no body come; But hark, I hear the footing of a man.   Enter Stephano.  LORENZO. Who comes so fast in silence of the night?  STEPHANO. A friend.  LORENZO. A friend! What friend? Your name, I pray you, friend?  STEPHANO. Stephano is my name, and I bring word My mistress will before the break of day Be here at Belmont. She doth stray about By holy crosses where she kneels and prays For happy wedlock hours.  LORENZO. Who comes with her?  STEPHANO. None but a holy hermit and her maid. I pray you is my master yet return’d?  LORENZO. He is not, nor we have not heard from him. But go we in, I pray thee, Jessica, And ceremoniously let us prepare Some welcome for the mistress of the house.   Enter Launcelet.  LAUNCELET. Sola, sola! wo ha, ho! sola, sola!  LORENZO. Who calls?  LAUNCELET. Sola! Did you see Master Lorenzo? Master Lorenzo! Sola, sola!  LORENZO. Leave holloaing, man. Here!  LAUNCELET. Sola! Where, where?  LORENZO. Here!  LAUNCELET. Tell him there’s a post come from my master with his horn full of good news. My master will be here ere morning.   [_Exit._]  LORENZO. Sweet soul, let’s in, and there expect their coming. And yet no matter; why should we go in? My friend Stephano, signify, I pray you, Within the house, your mistress is at hand, And bring your music forth into the air.   [_Exit Stephano._]  How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank! Here will we sit and let the sounds of music Creep in our ears; soft stillness and the night Become the touches of sweet harmony. Sit, Jessica. Look how the floor of heaven Is thick inlaid with patens of bright gold. There’s not the smallest orb which thou behold’st But in his motion like an angel sings, Still quiring to the young-eyed cherubins; Such harmony is in immortal souls, But whilst this muddy vesture of decay Doth grossly close it in, we cannot hear it.   Enter Musicians.  Come, ho! and wake Diana with a hymn. With sweetest touches pierce your mistress’ ear, And draw her home with music.   [_Music._]  JESSICA. I am never merry when I hear sweet music.  LORENZO. The reason is, your spirits are attentive. For do but note a wild and wanton herd Or race of youthful and unhandled colts, Fetching mad bounds, bellowing and neighing loud, Which is the hot condition of their blood, If they but hear perchance a trumpet sound, Or any air of music touch their ears, You shall perceive them make a mutual stand, Their savage eyes turn’d to a modest gaze By the sweet power of music: therefore the poet Did feign that Orpheus drew trees, stones, and floods, Since naught so stockish, hard, and full of rage, But music for the time doth change his nature. The man that hath no music in himself, Nor is not mov’d with concord of sweet sounds, Is fit for treasons, stratagems, and spoils; The motions of his spirit are dull as night, And his affections dark as Erebus. Let no such man be trusted. Mark the music.   Enter Portia and Nerissa.  PORTIA. That light we see is burning in my hall. How far that little candle throws his beams! So shines a good deed in a naughty world.  NERISSA. When the moon shone we did not see the candle.  PORTIA. So doth the greater glory dim the less. A substitute shines brightly as a king Until a king be by, and then his state Empties itself, as doth an inland brook Into the main of waters. Music! hark!  NERISSA. It is your music, madam, of the house.  PORTIA. Nothing is good, I see, without respect. Methinks it sounds much sweeter than by day.  NERISSA. Silence bestows that virtue on it, madam.  PORTIA. The crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark When neither is attended; and I think The nightingale, if she should sing by day When every goose is cackling, would be thought No better a musician than the wren. How many things by season season’d are To their right praise and true perfection! Peace! How the moon sleeps with Endymion, And would not be awak’d!   [_Music ceases._]  LORENZO. That is the voice, Or I am much deceiv’d, of Portia.  PORTIA. He knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo, By the bad voice.  LORENZO. Dear lady, welcome home.  PORTIA. We have been praying for our husbands’ welfare, Which speed, we hope, the better for our words. Are they return’d?  LORENZO. Madam, they are not yet; But there is come a messenger before To signify their coming.  PORTIA. Go in, Nerissa. Give order to my servants, that they take No note at all of our being absent hence, Nor you, Lorenzo; Jessica, nor you.   [_A tucket sounds._]  LORENZO. Your husband is at hand, I hear his trumpet. We are no tell-tales, madam, fear you not.  PORTIA. This night methinks is but the daylight sick, It looks a little paler. ’Tis a day Such as the day is when the sun is hid.   Enter Bassanio, Antonio, Gratiano and their Followers.  BASSANIO. We should hold day with the Antipodes, If you would walk in absence of the sun.  PORTIA. Let me give light, but let me not be light, For a light wife doth make a heavy husband, And never be Bassanio so for me. But God sort all! You are welcome home, my lord.  BASSANIO. I thank you, madam. Give welcome to my friend. This is the man, this is Antonio, To whom I am so infinitely bound.  PORTIA. You should in all sense be much bound to him, For, as I hear, he was much bound for you.  ANTONIO. No more than I am well acquitted of.  PORTIA. Sir, you are very welcome to our house. It must appear in other ways than words, Therefore I scant this breathing courtesy.  GRATIANO. [_To Nerissa_.] By yonder moon I swear you do me wrong, In faith, I gave it to the judge’s clerk. Would he were gelt that had it, for my part, Since you do take it, love, so much at heart.  PORTIA. A quarrel, ho, already! What’s the matter?  GRATIANO. About a hoop of gold, a paltry ring That she did give me, whose posy was For all the world like cutlers’ poetry Upon a knife, “Love me, and leave me not.”  NERISSA. What talk you of the posy, or the value? You swore to me when I did give it you, That you would wear it till your hour of death, And that it should lie with you in your grave. Though not for me, yet for your vehement oaths, You should have been respective and have kept it. Gave it a judge’s clerk! No, God’s my judge, The clerk will ne’er wear hair on’s face that had it.  GRATIANO. He will, and if he live to be a man.  NERISSA. Ay, if a woman live to be a man.  GRATIANO. Now, by this hand, I gave it to a youth, A kind of boy, a little scrubbed boy, No higher than thyself, the judge’s clerk, A prating boy that begg’d it as a fee, I could not for my heart deny it him.  PORTIA. You were to blame,—I must be plain with you,— To part so slightly with your wife’s first gift, A thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger, And so riveted with faith unto your flesh. I gave my love a ring, and made him swear Never to part with it, and here he stands. I dare be sworn for him he would not leave it Nor pluck it from his finger for the wealth That the world masters. Now, in faith, Gratiano, You give your wife too unkind a cause of grief, An ’twere to me I should be mad at it.  BASSANIO. [_Aside._] Why, I were best to cut my left hand off, And swear I lost the ring defending it.  GRATIANO. My Lord Bassanio gave his ring away Unto the judge that begg’d it, and indeed Deserv’d it too. And then the boy, his clerk, That took some pains in writing, he begg’d mine, And neither man nor master would take aught But the two rings.  PORTIA. What ring gave you, my lord? Not that, I hope, which you receiv’d of me.  BASSANIO. If I could add a lie unto a fault, I would deny it, but you see my finger Hath not the ring upon it, it is gone.  PORTIA. Even so void is your false heart of truth. By heaven, I will ne’er come in your bed Until I see the ring.  NERISSA. Nor I in yours Till I again see mine!  BASSANIO. Sweet Portia, If you did know to whom I gave the ring, If you did know for whom I gave the ring, And would conceive for what I gave the ring, And how unwillingly I left the ring, When nought would be accepted but the ring, You would abate the strength of your displeasure.  PORTIA. If you had known the virtue of the ring, Or half her worthiness that gave the ring, Or your own honour to contain the ring, You would not then have parted with the ring. What man is there so much unreasonable, If you had pleas’d to have defended it With any terms of zeal, wanted the modesty To urge the thing held as a ceremony? Nerissa teaches me what to believe: I’ll die for’t but some woman had the ring.  BASSANIO. No, by my honour, madam, by my soul, No woman had it, but a civil doctor, Which did refuse three thousand ducats of me, And begg’d the ring, the which I did deny him, And suffer’d him to go displeas’d away, Even he that had held up the very life Of my dear friend. What should I say, sweet lady? I was enforc’d to send it after him. I was beset with shame and courtesy. My honour would not let ingratitude So much besmear it. Pardon me, good lady; For by these blessed candles of the night, Had you been there, I think you would have begg’d The ring of me to give the worthy doctor.  PORTIA. Let not that doctor e’er come near my house, Since he hath got the jewel that I loved, And that which you did swear to keep for me, I will become as liberal as you, I’ll not deny him anything I have, No, not my body, nor my husband’s bed. Know him I shall, I am well sure of it. Lie not a night from home. Watch me like Argus, If you do not, if I be left alone, Now by mine honour which is yet mine own, I’ll have that doctor for mine bedfellow.  NERISSA. And I his clerk. Therefore be well advis’d How you do leave me to mine own protection.  GRATIANO. Well, do you so. Let not me take him then, For if I do, I’ll mar the young clerk’s pen.  ANTONIO. I am th’ unhappy subject of these quarrels.  PORTIA. Sir, grieve not you. You are welcome notwithstanding.  BASSANIO. Portia, forgive me this enforced wrong, And in the hearing of these many friends I swear to thee, even by thine own fair eyes, Wherein I see myself—  PORTIA. Mark you but that! In both my eyes he doubly sees himself, In each eye one. Swear by your double self, And there’s an oath of credit.  BASSANIO. Nay, but hear me. Pardon this fault, and by my soul I swear I never more will break an oath with thee.  ANTONIO. I once did lend my body for his wealth, Which but for him that had your husband’s ring Had quite miscarried. I dare be bound again, My soul upon the forfeit, that your lord Will never more break faith advisedly.  PORTIA. Then you shall be his surety. Give him this, And bid him keep it better than the other.  ANTONIO. Here, Lord Bassanio, swear to keep this ring.  BASSANIO. By heaven, it is the same I gave the doctor!  PORTIA. I had it of him: pardon me, Bassanio, For by this ring, the doctor lay with me.  NERISSA. And pardon me, my gentle Gratiano, For that same scrubbed boy, the doctor’s clerk, In lieu of this, last night did lie with me.  GRATIANO. Why, this is like the mending of highways In summer, where the ways are fair enough. What, are we cuckolds ere we have deserv’d it?  PORTIA. Speak not so grossly. You are all amaz’d. Here is a letter; read it at your leisure. It comes from Padua from Bellario. There you shall find that Portia was the doctor, Nerissa there, her clerk. Lorenzo here Shall witness I set forth as soon as you, And even but now return’d. I have not yet Enter’d my house. Antonio, you are welcome, And I have better news in store for you Than you expect: unseal this letter soon. There you shall find three of your argosies Are richly come to harbour suddenly. You shall not know by what strange accident I chanced on this letter.  ANTONIO. I am dumb.  BASSANIO. Were you the doctor, and I knew you not?  GRATIANO. Were you the clerk that is to make me cuckold?  NERISSA. Ay, but the clerk that never means to do it, Unless he live until he be a man.  BASSANIO. Sweet doctor, you shall be my bedfellow. When I am absent, then lie with my wife.  ANTONIO. Sweet lady, you have given me life and living; For here I read for certain that my ships Are safely come to road.  PORTIA. How now, Lorenzo! My clerk hath some good comforts too for you.  NERISSA. Ay, and I’ll give them him without a fee. There do I give to you and Jessica, From the rich Jew, a special deed of gift, After his death, of all he dies possess’d of.  LORENZO. Fair ladies, you drop manna in the way Of starved people.  PORTIA. It is almost morning, And yet I am sure you are not satisfied Of these events at full. Let us go in, And charge us there upon inter’gatories, And we will answer all things faithfully.  GRATIANO. Let it be so. The first inter’gatory That my Nerissa shall be sworn on is, Whether till the next night she had rather stay, Or go to bed now, being two hours to day. But were the day come, I should wish it dark Till I were couching with the doctor’s clerk. Well, while I live, I’ll fear no other thing So sore as keeping safe Nerissa’s ring.   [_Exeunt._]'"

              "'S. In delivering my son from me, I bury a second husband.  BERTRAM. And I in going, madam, weep o’er my father’s death anew; but I must attend his majesty’s command, to whom I am now in ward, evermore in subjection.  LAFEW. You shall find of the king a husband, madam; you, sir, a father. He that so generally is at all times good, must of necessity hold his virtue to you, whose worthiness would stir it up where it wanted, rather than lack it where there is such abundance.  COUNTESS. What hope is there of his majesty’s amendment?  LAFEW. He hath abandon’d his physicians, madam; under whose practices he hath persecuted time with hope, and finds no other advantage in the process but only the losing of hope by time.  COUNTESS. This young gentlewoman had a father—O that “had!”, how sad a passage ’tis!—whose skill was almost as great as his honesty; had it stretch’d so far, would have made nature immortal, and death should have play for lack of work. Would for the king’s sake he were living! I think it would be the death of the king’s disease.  LAFEW. How called you the man you speak of, madam?  COUNTESS. He was famous, sir, in his profession, and it was his great right to be so: Gerard de Narbon.  LAFEW. He was excellent indeed, madam; the king very lately spoke of him admiringly, and mourningly; he was skilful enough to have liv’d still, if knowledge could be set up against mortality.  BERTRAM. What is it, my good lord, the king languishes of?  LAFEW. A fistula, my lord.  BERTRAM. I heard not of it before.  LAFEW. I would it were not notorious. Was this gentlewoman the daughter of Gerard de Narbon?  COUNTESS. His sole child, my lord, and bequeathed to my overlooking. I have those hopes of her good that her education promises her dispositions she inherits, which makes fair gifts fairer; for where an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities, there commendations go with pity, they are virtues and traitors too. In her they are the better for their simpleness; she derives her honesty, and achieves her goodness.  LAFEW. Your commendations, madam, get from her tears.  COUNTESS. ’Tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise in. The remembrance of her father never approaches her heart but the tyranny of her sorrows takes all livelihood from her cheek. No more of this, Helena; go to, no more, lest it be rather thought you affect a sorrow than to have.  HELENA. I do affect a sorrow indeed, but I have it too.  LAFEW. Moderate lamentation is the right of the dead; excessive grief the enemy to the living.  COUNTESS. If the living be enemy to the grief, the excess makes it soon mortal.  BERTRAM. Madam, I desire your holy wishes.  LAFEW. How understand we that?  COUNTESS. Be thou blest, Bertram, and succeed thy father In manners, as in shape! Thy blood and virtue Contend for empire in thee, and thy goodness Share with thy birthright! Love all, trust a few, Do wrong to none. Be able for thine enemy Rather in power than use; and keep thy friend Under thy own life’s key. Be check’d for silence, But never tax’d for speech. What heaven more will, That thee may furnish and my prayers pluck down, Fall on thy head! Farewell. My lord, ’Tis an unseason’d courtier; good my lord, Advise him.  LAFEW. He cannot want the best That shall attend his love.  COUNTESS. Heaven bless him! Farewell, Bertram.   [_Exit Countess._]  BERTRAM. The best wishes that can be forg’d in your thoughts be servants to you! [_To Helena._] Be comfortable to my mother, your mistress, and make much of her.  LAFEW. Farewell, pretty lady, you must hold the credit of your father.   [_Exeunt Bertram and Lafew._]  HELENA. O, were that all! I think not on my father, And these great tears grace his remembrance more Than those I shed for him. What was he like? I have forgot him; my imagination Carries no favour in’t but Bertram’s. I am undone: there is no living, none, If Bertram be away. ’Twere all one That I should love a bright particular star, And think to wed it, he is so above me. In his bright radiance and collateral light Must I be comforted, not in his sphere. Th’ambition in my love thus plagues itself: The hind that would be mated by the lion Must die for love. ’Twas pretty, though a plague, To see him every hour; to sit and draw His arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls, In our heart’s table,—heart too capable Of every line and trick of his sweet favour. But now he’s gone, and my idolatrous fancy Must sanctify his relics. Who comes here?   Enter Parolles.  One that goes with him: I love him for his sake, And yet I know him a notorious liar, Think him a great way fool, solely a coward; Yet these fix’d evils sit so fit in him That they take place when virtue’s steely bones Looks bleak i’ th’ cold wind: withal, full oft we see Cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly.  PAROLLES. Save you, fair queen!  HELENA. And you, monarch!  PAROLLES. No.  HELENA. And no.  PAROLLES. Are you meditating on virginity?  HELENA. Ay. You have some stain of soldier in you; let me ask you a question. Man is enemy to virginity; how may we barricado it against him?  PAROLLES. Keep him out.  HELENA. But he assails; and our virginity, though valiant, in the defence, yet is weak. Unfold to us some warlike resistance.  PAROLLES. There is none. Man setting down before you will undermine you and blow you up.  HELENA. Bless our poor virginity from underminers and blowers-up! Is there no military policy how virgins might blow up men?  PAROLLES. Virginity being blown down, man will quicklier be blown up; marry, in blowing him down again, with the breach yourselves made, you lose your city. It is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to preserve virginity. Loss of virginity is rational increase, and there was never virgin got till virginity was first lost. That you were made of is metal to make virgins. Virginity, by being once lost, may be ten times found; by being ever kept, it is ever lost. ’Tis too cold a companion. Away with it!  HELENA. I will stand for’t a little, though therefore I die a virgin.  PAROLLES. There’s little can be said in’t; ’tis against the rule of nature. To speak on the part of virginity is to accuse your mothers; which is most infallible disobedience. He that hangs himself is a virgin: virginity murders itself, and should be buried in highways out of all sanctified limit, as a desperate offendress against nature. Virginity breeds mites, much like a cheese; consumes itself to the very paring, and so dies with feeding his own stomach. Besides, virginity is peevish, proud, idle, made of self-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the canon. Keep it not; you cannot choose but lose by’t. Out with’t! Within the year it will make itself two, which is a goodly increase, and the principal itself not much the worse. Away with it!  HELENA. How might one do, sir, to lose it to her own liking?  PAROLLES. Let me see. Marry, ill, to like him that ne’er it likes. ’Tis a commodity will lose the gloss with lying; the longer kept, the less worth. Off with’t while ’tis vendible; answer the time of request. Virginity, like an old courtier, wears her cap out of fashion, richly suited, but unsuitable, just like the brooch and the toothpick, which wear not now. Your date is better in your pie and your porridge than in your cheek. And your virginity, your old virginity, is like one of our French wither’d pears; it looks ill, it eats drily; marry, ’tis a wither’d pear; it was formerly better; marry, yet ’tis a wither’d pear. Will you anything with it?  HELENA. Not my virginity yet. There shall your master have a thousand loves, A mother, and a mistress, and a friend, A phoenix, captain, and an enemy, A guide, a goddess, and a sovereign, A counsellor, a traitress, and a dear: His humble ambition, proud humility, His jarring concord, and his discord dulcet, His faith, his sweet disaster; with a world Of pretty, fond, adoptious christendoms That blinking Cupid gossips. Now shall he— I know not what he shall. God send him well! The court’s a learning-place; and he is one.  PAROLLES. What one, i’ faith?  HELENA. That I wish well. ’Tis pity—  PAROLLES. What’s pity?  HELENA. That wishing well had not a body in’t Which might be felt, that we, the poorer born, Whose baser stars do shut us up in wishes, Might with effects of them follow our friends, And show what we alone must think, which never Returns us thanks.   Enter a Page.  PAGE. Monsieur Parolles, my lord calls for you.   [_Exit Page._]  PAROLLES. Little Helen, farewell. If I can remember thee, I will think of thee at court.  HELENA. Monsieur Parolles, you were born under a charitable star.  PAROLLES. Under Mars, I.  HELENA. I especially think, under Mars.  PAROLLES. Why under Mars?  HELENA. The wars hath so kept you under, that you must needs be born under Mars.  PAROLLES. When he was predominant.  HELENA. When he was retrograde, I think rather.  PAROLLES. Why think you so?  HELENA. You go so much backward when you fight.  PAROLLES. That’s for advantage.  HELENA. So is running away, when fear proposes the safety: but the composition that your valour and fear makes in you is a virtue of a good wing, and I like the wear well.  PAROLLES. I am so full of business I cannot answer thee acutely. I will return perfect courtier; in the which my instruction shall serve to naturalize thee, so thou wilt be capable of a courtier’s counsel, and understand what advice shall thrust upon thee; else thou diest in thine unthankfulness, and thine ignorance makes thee away. Farewell. When thou hast leisure, say thy prayers; when thou hast none, remember thy friends. Get thee a good husband, and use him as he uses thee. So, farewell.   [_Exit._]  HELENA. Our remedies oft in ourselves do lie, Which we ascribe to heaven: the fated sky Gives us free scope; only doth backward pull Our slow designs when we ourselves are dull. What power is it which mounts my love so high, That makes me see, and cannot feed mine eye? The mightiest space in fortune nature brings To join like likes, and kiss like native things. Impossible be strange attempts to those That weigh their pains in sense, and do suppose What hath been cannot be. Who ever strove To show her merit that did miss her love? The king’s disease,—my project may deceive me, But my intents are fix’d, and will not leave me.   [_Exit._]  SCENE II. Paris. A room in the King’s palace.   Flourish of cornets. Enter the King of France, with letters; Lords and  others attending.  KING. The Florentines and Senoys are by th’ ears; Have fought with equal fortune, and continue A braving war.  FIRST LORD. So ’tis reported, sir.  KING. Nay, ’tis most credible, we here receive it, A certainty, vouch’d from our cousin Austria, With caution, that the Florentine will move us For speedy aid; wherein our dearest friend Prejudicates the business, and would seem To have us make denial.  FIRST LORD. His love and wisdom, Approv’d so to your majesty, may plead For amplest credence.  KING. He hath arm’d our answer, And Florence is denied before he comes: Yet, for our gentlemen that mean to see The Tuscan service, freely have they leave To stand on either part.  SECOND LORD. It well may serve A nursery to our gentry, who are sick For breathing and exploit.  KING. What’s he comes here?   Enter Bertram, Lafew and Parolles.  FIRST LORD. It is the Count Rossillon, my good lord, Young Bertram.  KING. Youth, thou bear’st thy father’s face; Frank nature, rather curious than in haste, Hath well compos’d thee. Thy father’s moral parts Mayst thou inherit too! Welcome to Paris.  BERTRAM. My thanks and duty are your majesty’s.  KING. I would I had that corporal soundness now, As when thy father and myself in friendship First tried our soldiership. He did look far Into the service of the time, and was Discipled of the bravest. He lasted long, But on us both did haggish age steal on, And wore us out of act. It much repairs me To talk of your good father; in his youth He had the wit which I can well observe Today in our young lords; but they may jest Till their own scorn return to them unnoted Ere they can hide their levity in honour So like a courtier, contempt nor bitterness Were in his pride or sharpness; if they were, His equal had awak’d them, and his honour, Clock to itself, knew the true minute when Exception bid him speak, and at this time His tongue obey’d his hand. Who were below him He us’d as creatures of another place, And bow’d his eminent top to their low ranks, Making them proud of his humility, In their poor praise he humbled. Such a man Might be a copy to these younger times; Which, followed well, would demonstrate them now But goers backward.  BERTRAM. His good remembrance, sir, Lies richer in your thoughts than on his tomb; So in approof lives not his epitaph As in your royal speech.  KING. Would I were with him! He would always say,— Methinks I hear him now; his plausive words He scatter’d not in ears, but grafted them To grow there and to bear,—“Let me not live,” This his good melancholy oft began On the catastrophe and heel of pastime, When it was out,—“Let me not live” quoth he, “After my flame lacks oil, to be the snuff Of younger spirits, whose apprehensive senses All but new things disdain; whose judgments are Mere fathers of their garments; whose constancies Expire before their fashions.” This he wish’d. I, after him, do after him wish too, Since I nor wax nor honey can bring home, I quickly were dissolved from my hive To give some labourers room.  SECOND LORD. You’re lov’d, sir; They that least lend it you shall lack you first.  KING. I fill a place, I know’t. How long is’t, Count, Since the physician at your father’s died? He was much fam’d.  BERTRAM. Some six months since, my lord.  KING. If he were living, I would try him yet;— Lend me an arm;—the rest have worn me out With several applications; nature and sickness Debate it at their leisure. Welcome, Count; My son’s no dearer.  BERTRAM. Thank your majesty.   [_Exeunt. Flourish._]  SCENE III. Rossillon. A Room in the Palace.   Enter Countess, Steward and Clown.  COUNTESS. I will now hear. What say you of this gentlewoman?  STEWARD. Madam, the care I have had to even your content, I wish might be found in the calendar of my past endeavours; for then we wound our modesty, and make foul the clearness of our deservings, when of ourselves we publish them.  COUNTESS. What does this knave here? Get you gone, sirrah. The complaints I have heard of you I do not all believe; ’tis my slowness that I do not; for I know you lack not folly to commit them, and have ability enough to make such knaveries yours.  CLOWN. ’Tis not unknown to you, madam, I am a poor fellow.  COUNTESS. Well, sir.  CLOWN. No, madam, ’tis not so well that I am poor, though many of the rich are damned; but if I may have your ladyship’s good will to go to the world, Isbel the woman and I will do as we may.  COUNTESS. Wilt thou needs be a beggar?  CLOWN. I do beg your good will in this case.  COUNTESS. In what case?  CLOWN. In Isbel’s case and mine own. Service is no heritage, and I think I shall never have the blessing of God till I have issue of my body; for they say barnes are blessings.  COUNTESS. Tell me thy reason why thou wilt marry.  CLOWN. My poor body, madam, requires it; I am driven on by the flesh, and he must needs go that the devil drives.  COUNTESS. Is this all your worship’s reason?  CLOWN. Faith, madam, I have other holy reasons, such as they are.  COUNTESS. May the world know them?  CLOWN. I have been, madam, a wicked creature, as you and all flesh and blood are; and indeed I do marry that I may repent.  COUNTESS. Thy marriage, sooner than thy wickedness.  CLOWN. I am out of friends, madam, and I hope to have friends for my wife’s sake.  COUNTESS. Such friends are thine enemies, knave.  CLOWN. Y’are shallow, madam, in great friends; for the knaves come to do that for me which I am a-weary of. He that ears my land spares my team, and gives me leave to in the crop: if I be his cuckold, he’s my drudge. He that comforts my wife is the cherisher of my flesh and blood; he that cherishes my flesh and blood loves my flesh and blood; he that loves my flesh and blood is my friend; ergo, he that kisses my wife is my friend. If men could be contented to be what they are, there were no fear in marriage; for young Charbon the puritan and old Poysam the papist, howsome’er their hearts are sever’d in religion, their heads are both one; they may jowl horns together like any deer i’ the herd.  COUNTESS. Wilt thou ever be a foul-mouth’d and calumnious knave?  CLOWN. A prophet I, madam; and I speak the truth the next way:    _For I the ballad will repeat,    Which men full true shall find;    Your marriage comes by destiny,    Your cuckoo sings by kind._  COUNTESS. Get you gone, sir; I’ll talk with you more anon.  STEWARD. May it please you, madam, that he bid Helen come to you; of her I am to speak.  COUNTESS. Sirrah, tell my gentlewoman I would speak with her; Helen I mean.  CLOWN. [_Sings._] _   Was this fair face the cause, quoth she,      Why the Grecians sacked Troy?    Fond done, done fond,       Was this King Priam’s joy?    With that she sighed as she stood,    With that she sighed as she stood,       And gave this sentence then:    Among nine bad if one be good,    Among nine bad if one be good,      There’s yet one good in ten._  COUNTESS. What, one good in ten? You corrupt the song, sirrah.  CLOWN. One good woman in ten, madam, which is a purifying o’ the song. Would God would serve the world so all the year! We’d find no fault with the tithe-woman, if I were the parson. One in ten, quoth ’a! And we might have a good woman born but or every blazing star, or at an earthquake, ’twould mend the lottery well; a man may draw his heart out ere he pluck one.  COUNTESS. You’ll be gone, sir knave, and do as I command you!  CLOWN. That man should be at woman’s command, and yet no hurt done! Though honesty be no puritan, yet it will do no hurt; it will wear the surplice of humility over the black gown of a big heart. I am going, forsooth; the business is for Helen to come hither.   [_Exit._]  COUNTESS. Well, now.  STEWARD. I know, madam, you love your gentlewoman entirely.  COUNTESS. Faith I do. Her father bequeath’d her to me, and she herself, without other advantage, may lawfully make title to as much love as she finds; there is more owing her than is paid, and more shall be paid her than she’ll demand.  STEWARD. Madam, I was very late more near her than I think she wish’d me; alone she was, and did communicate to herself her own words to her own ears; she thought, I dare vow for her, they touch’d not any stranger sense. Her matter was, she loved your son. Fortune, she said, was no goddess, that had put such difference betwixt their two estates; Love no god, that would not extend his might only where qualities were level; Diana no queen of virgins, that would suffer her poor knight surpris’d, without rescue in the first assault or ransom afterward. This she deliver’d in the most bitter touch of sorrow that e’er I heard virgin exclaim in, which I held my duty speedily to acquaint you withal; sithence, in the loss that may happen, it concerns you something to know it.  COUNTESS. You have discharg’d this honestly; keep it to yourself; many likelihoods inform’d me of this before, which hung so tottering in the balance that I could neither believe nor misdoubt. Pray you leave me; stall this in your bosom; and I thank you for your honest care. I will speak with you further anon.   [_Exit Steward._]   Enter Helena.  Even so it was with me when I was young; If ever we are nature’s, these are ours; this thorn Doth to our rose of youth rightly belong; Our blood to us, this to our blood is born; It is the show and seal of nature’s truth, Where love’s strong passion is impress’d in youth. By our remembrances of days foregone, Such were our faults, or then we thought them none. Her eye is sick on’t; I observe her now.  HELENA. What is your pleasure, madam?  COUNTESS. You know, Helen, I am a mother to you.  HELENA. Mine honourable mistress.  COUNTESS. Nay, a mother. Why not a mother? When I said a mother, Methought you saw a serpent. What’s in mother, That you start at it? I say I am your mother, And put you in the catalogue of those That were enwombed mine. ’Tis often seen Adoption strives with nature, and choice breeds A native slip to us from foreign seeds. You ne’er oppress’d me with a mother’s groan, Yet I express to you a mother’s care. God’s mercy, maiden! does it curd thy blood To say I am thy mother? What’s the matter, That this distempered messenger of wet, The many-colour’d Iris, rounds thine eye? —Why, that you are my daughter?  HELENA. That I am not.  COUNTESS. I say, I am your mother.  HELENA. Pardon, madam; The Count Rossillon cannot be my brother. I am from humble, he from honoured name; No note upon my parents, his all noble, My master, my dear lord he is; and I His servant live, and will his vassal die. He must not be my brother.  COUNTESS. Nor I your mother?  HELENA. You are my mother, madam; would you were— So that my lord your son were not my brother,— Indeed my mother! or were you both our mothers, I care no more for than I do for heaven, So I were not his sister. Can’t no other, But, I your daughter, he must be my brother?  COUNTESS. Yes, Helen, you might be my daughter-in-law. God shield you mean it not! daughter and mother So strive upon your pulse. What! pale again? My fear hath catch’d your fondness; now I see The mystery of your loneliness, and find Your salt tears’ head. Now to all sense ’tis gross You love my son; invention is asham’d, Against the proclamation of thy passion To say thou dost not. Therefore tell me true; But tell me then, ’tis so; for, look, thy cheeks Confess it, t’one to th’other; and thine eyes See it so grossly shown in thy behaviours, That in their kind they speak it; only sin And hellish obstinacy tie thy tongue, That truth should be suspected. Speak, is’t so? If it be so, you have wound a goodly clew; If it be not, forswear’t: howe’er, I charge thee, As heaven shall work in me for thine avail, To tell me truly.  HELENA. Good madam, pardon me.  COUNTESS. Do you love my son?  HELENA. Your pardon, noble mistress.  COUNTESS. Love you my son?  HELENA. Do not you love him, madam?  COUNTESS. Go not about; my love hath in’t a bond Whereof the world takes note. Come, come, disclose The state of your affection, for your passions Have to the full appeach’d.  HELENA. Then I confess, Here on my knee, before high heaven and you, That before you, and next unto high heaven, I love your son. My friends were poor, but honest; so’s my love. Be not offended; for it hurts not him That he is lov’d of me; I follow him not By any token of presumptuous suit, Nor would I have him till I do deserve him; Yet never know how that desert should be. I know I love in vain, strive against hope; Yet in this captious and inteemable sieve I still pour in the waters of my love And lack not to lose still. Thus, Indian-like, Religious in mine error, I adore The sun that looks upon his worshipper, But knows of him no more. My dearest madam, Let not your hate encounter with my love, For loving where you do; but if yourself, Whose aged honour cites a virtuous youth, Did ever, in so true a flame of liking, Wish chastely, and love dearly, that your Dian Was both herself and love; O then, give pity To her whose state is such that cannot choose But lend and give where she is sure to lose; That seeks not to find that her search implies, But riddle-like, lives sweetly where she dies!  COUNTESS. Had you not lately an intent,—speak truly,— To go to Paris?  HELENA. Madam, I had.  COUNTESS. Wherefore? tell true.  HELENA. I will tell truth; by grace itself I swear. You know my father left me some prescriptions Of rare and prov’d effects, such as his reading And manifest experience had collected For general sovereignty; and that he will’d me In heedfull’st reservation to bestow them, As notes whose faculties inclusive were More than they were in note. Amongst the rest There is a remedy, approv’d, set down, To cure the desperate languishings whereof The king is render’d lost.  COUNTESS. This was your motive For Paris, was it? Speak.  HELENA. My lord your son made me to think of this; Else Paris, and the medicine, and the king, Had from the conversation of my thoughts Haply been absent then.  COUNTESS. But think you, Helen, If you should tender your supposed aid, He would receive it? He and his physicians Are of a mind; he, that they cannot help him; They, that they cannot help. How shall they credit A poor unlearned virgin, when the schools, Embowell’d of their doctrine, have let off The danger to itself?  HELENA. There’s something in’t More than my father’s skill, which was the great’st Of his profession, that his good receipt Shall for my legacy be sanctified By th’ luckiest stars in heaven; and would your honour But give me leave to try success, I’d venture The well-lost life of mine on his grace’s cure. By such a day, an hour.  COUNTESS. Dost thou believe’t?  HELENA. Ay, madam, knowingly.  COUNTESS. Why, Helen, thou shalt have my leave and love, Means and attendants, and my loving greetings To those of mine in court. I’ll stay at home, And pray God’s blessing into thy attempt. Be gone tomorrow; and be sure of this, What I can help thee to, thou shalt not miss.   [_Exeunt._]   ACT II.  SCENE I. Paris. A room in the King’s palace.   Flourish. Enter the King with young Lords taking leave for the  Florentine war; Bertram, Parolles and Attendants.  KING. Farewell, young lords; these warlike principles Do not throw from you; and you, my lords, farewell; Share the advice betwixt you; if both gain all, The gift doth stretch itself as ’tis receiv’d, And is enough for both.  FIRST LORD. ’Tis our hope, sir, After well-ent’red soldiers, to return And find your grace in health.  KING. No, no, it cannot be; and yet my heart Will not confess he owes the malady That doth my life besiege. Farewell, young lords. Whether I live or die, be you the sons Of worthy Frenchmen; let higher Italy,— Those bated that inherit but the fall Of the last monarchy—see that you come Not to woo honour, but to wed it, when The bravest questant shrinks: find what you seek, That fame may cry you loud. I say farewell.  SECOND LORD. Health, at your bidding serve your majesty!  KING. Those girls of Italy, take heed of them; They say our French lack language to deny If they demand; beware of being captives Before you serve.  BOTH. Our hearts receive your warnings.  KING. Farewell.—Come hither to me.   [_The King retires to a couch._]  FIRST LORD. O my sweet lord, that you will stay behind us!  PAROLLES. ’Tis not his fault; the spark.  SECOND LORD. O, ’tis brave wars!  PAROLLES. Most admirable! I have seen those wars.  BERTRAM. I am commanded here, and kept a coil with, “Too young”, and “the next year” and “’tis too early”.  PAROLLES. An thy mind stand to’t, boy, steal away bravely.  BERTRAM. I shall stay here the forehorse to a smock, Creaking my shoes on the plain masonry, Till honour be bought up, and no sword worn But one to dance with. By heaven, I’ll steal away.  FIRST LORD. There’s honour in the theft.  PAROLLES. Commit it, count.  SECOND LORD. I am your accessary; and so farewell.  BERTRAM. I grow to you, and our parting is a tortur’d body.  FIRST LORD. Farewell, captain.  SECOND LORD. Sweet Monsieur Parolles!  PAROLLES. Noble heroes, my sword and yours are kin. Good sparks and lustrous, a word, good metals. You shall find in the regiment of the Spinii one Captain Spurio, with his cicatrice, an emblem of war, here on his sinister cheek; it was this very sword entrench’d it. Say to him I live; and observe his reports for me.  FIRST LORD. We shall, noble captain.  PAROLLES. Mars dote on you for his novices!   [_Exeunt Lords._]  What will ye do?  BERTRAM. Stay the king.  PAROLLES. Use a more spacious ceremony to the noble lords; you have restrain’d yourself within the list of too cold an adieu. Be more expressive to them; for they wear themselves in the cap of the time; there do muster true gait; eat, speak, and move, under the influence of the most receiv’d star; and though the devil lead the measure, such are to be followed. After them, and take a more dilated farewell.  BERTRAM. And I will do so.  PAROLLES. Worthy fellows, and like to prove most sinewy sword-men.   [_Exeunt Bertram and Parolles._]   Enter Lafew.  LAFEW. Pardon, my lord [_kneeling_], for me and for my tidings.  KING. I’ll fee thee to stand up.  LAFEW. Then here’s a man stands that has brought his pardon. I would you had kneel’d, my lord, to ask me mercy, And that at my bidding you could so stand up.  KING. I would I had; so I had broke thy pate, And ask’d thee mercy for’t.  LAFEW. Good faith, across; But, my good lord, ’tis thus: will you be cur’d Of your infirmity?  KING. No.  LAFEW. O, will you eat No grapes, my royal fox? Yes, but you will My noble grapes, and if my royal fox Could reach them. I have seen a medicine That’s able to breathe life into a stone, Quicken a rock, and make you dance canary With sprightly fire and motion; whose simple touch Is powerful to araise King Pippen, nay, To give great Charlemain a pen in’s hand And write to her a love-line.  KING. What ‘her’ is this?  LAFEW. Why, doctor ‘she’! My lord, there’s one arriv’d, If you will see her. Now, by my faith and honour, If seriously I may convey my thoughts In this my light deliverance, I have spoke With one that in her sex, her years, profession, Wisdom, and constancy, hath amaz’d me more Than I dare blame my weakness. Will you see her, For that is her demand, and know her business? That done, laugh well at me.  KING. Now, good Lafew, Bring in the admiration; that we with thee May spend our wonder too, or take off thine By wond’ring how thou took’st it.  LAFEW. Nay, I’ll fit you, And not be all day neither.   [_Exit Lafew._]  KING. Thus he his special nothing ever prologues.   Enter Lafew with Helena.  LAFEW. Nay, come your ways.  KING. This haste hath wings indeed.  LAFEW. Nay, come your ways. This is his majesty, say your mind to him. A traitor you do look like, but such traitors His majesty seldom fears; I am Cressid’s uncle, That dare leave two together. Fare you well.   [_Exit._]  KING. Now, fair one, does your business follow us?  HELENA. Ay, my good lord. Gerard de Narbon was my father, In what he did profess, well found.  KING. I knew him.  HELENA. The rather will I spare my praises towards him. Knowing him is enough. On his bed of death Many receipts he gave me; chiefly one, Which, as the dearest issue of his practice, And of his old experience the only darling, He bade me store up as a triple eye, Safer than mine own two; more dear I have so, And hearing your high majesty is touch’d With that malignant cause, wherein the honour Of my dear father’s gift stands chief in power, I come to tender it, and my appliance, With all bound humbleness.  KING. We thank you, maiden, But may not be so credulous of cure, When our most learned doctors leave us, and The congregated college have concluded That labouring art can never ransom nature From her inaidable estate. I say we must not So stain our judgment, or corrupt our hope, To prostitute our past-cure malady To empirics, or to dissever so Our great self and our credit, to esteem A senseless help, when help past sense we deem.  HELENA. My duty then shall pay me for my pains. I will no more enforce mine office on you, Humbly entreating from your royal thoughts A modest one to bear me back again.  KING. I cannot give thee less, to be call’d grateful. Thou thought’st to help me; and such thanks I give As one near death to those that wish him live. But what at full I know, thou know’st no part; I knowing all my peril, thou no art.  HELENA. What I can do can do no hurt to try, Since you set up your rest ’gainst remedy. He that of greatest works is finisher Oft does them by the weakest minister. So holy writ in babes hath judgment shown, When judges have been babes. Great floods have flown From simple sources, and great seas have dried When miracles have by the great’st been denied. Oft expectation fails, and most oft there Where most it promises; and oft it hits Where hope is coldest, and despair most fits.  KING. I must not hear thee. Fare thee well, kind maid. Thy pains, not us’d, must by thyself be paid; Proffers, not took, reap thanks for their reward.  HELENA. Inspired merit so by breath is barr’d. It is not so with Him that all things knows As ’tis with us that square our guess by shows; But most it is presumption in us when The help of heaven we count the act of men. Dear sir, to my endeavours give consent; Of heaven, not me, make an experiment. I am not an impostor, that proclaim Myself against the level of mine aim, But know I think, and think I know most sure, My art is not past power nor you past cure.  KING. Art thou so confident? Within what space Hop’st thou my cure?  HELENA. The greatest grace lending grace. Ere twice the horses of the sun shall bring Their fiery torcher his diurnal ring, Ere twice in murk and occidental damp Moist Hesperus hath quench’d her sleepy lamp; Or four and twenty times the pilot’s glass Hath told the thievish minutes how they pass; What is infirm from your sound parts shall fly, Health shall live free, and sickness freely die.  KING. Upon thy certainty and confidence What dar’st thou venture?  HELENA. Tax of impudence, A strumpet’s boldness, a divulged shame, Traduc’d by odious ballads; my maiden’s name Sear’d otherwise; ne worse of worst extended With vildest torture, let my life be ended.  KING. Methinks in thee some blessed spirit doth speak His powerful sound within an organ weak; And what impossibility would slay In common sense, sense saves another way. Thy life is dear, for all that life can rate Worth name of life in thee hath estimate: Youth, beauty, wisdom, courage, all That happiness and prime can happy call. Thou this to hazard needs must intimate Skill infinite, or monstrous desperate. Sweet practiser, thy physic I will try, That ministers thine own death if I die.  HELENA. If I break time, or flinch in property Of what I spoke, unpitied let me die, And well deserv’d. Not helping, death’s my fee; But if I help, what do you promise me?  KING. Make thy demand.  HELENA. But will you make it even?  KING. Ay, by my sceptre and my hopes of heaven.  HELENA. Then shalt thou give me, with thy kingly hand What husband in thy power I will command: Exempted be from me the arrogance To choose from forth the royal blood of France, My low and humble name to propagate With any branch or image of thy state; But such a one, thy vassal, whom I know Is free for me to ask, thee to bestow.  KING. Here is my hand; the premises observ’d, Thy will by my performance shall be serv’d; So make the choice of thy own time, for I, Thy resolv’d patient, on thee still rely. More should I question thee, and more I must, Though more to know could not be more to trust: From whence thou cam’st, how tended on; but rest Unquestion’d welcome, and undoubted bless’d. Give me some help here, ho! If thou proceed As high as word, my deed shall match thy deed.   [_Flourish. Exeunt._]  SCENE II. Rossillon. A room in the Countess’s palace.   Enter Countess and Clown.  COUNTESS. Come on, sir; I shall now put you to the height of your breeding.  CLOWN. I will show myself highly fed and lowly taught. I know my business is but to the court.  COUNTESS. To the court! Why, what place make you special, when you put off that with such contempt? But to the court!  CLOWN. Truly, madam, if God have lent a man any manners, he may easily put it off at court: he that cannot make a leg, put off’s cap, kiss his hand, and say nothing, has neither leg, hands, lip, nor cap; and indeed such a fellow, to say precisely, were not for the court; but for me, I have an answer will serve all men.  COUNTESS. Marry, that’s a bountiful answer that fits all questions.  CLOWN. It is like a barber’s chair, that fits all buttocks—the pin-buttock, the quatch-buttock, the brawn-buttock, or any buttock.  COUNTESS. Will your answer serve fit to all questions?  CLOWN. As fit as ten groats is for the hand of an attorney, as your French crown for your taffety punk, as Tib’s rush for Tom’s forefinger, as a pancake for Shrove-Tuesday, a morris for May-day, as the nail to his hole, the cuckold to his horn, as a scolding quean to a wrangling knave, as the nun’s lip to the friar’s mouth; nay, as the pudding to his skin.  COUNTESS. Have you, I say, an answer of such fitness for all questions?  CLOWN. From below your duke to beneath your constable, it will fit any question.  COUNTESS. It must be an answer of most monstrous size that must fit all demands.  CLOWN. But a trifle neither, in good faith, if the learned should speak truth of it. Here it is, and all that belongs to’t. Ask me if I am a courtier; it shall do you no harm to learn.  COUNTESS. To be young again, if we could: I will be a fool in question, hoping to be the wiser by your answer. I pray you, sir, are you a courtier?  CLOWN. O Lord, sir! There’s a simple putting off. More, more, a hundred of them.  COUNTESS. Sir, I am a poor friend of yours, that loves you.  CLOWN. O Lord, sir! Thick, thick; spare not me.  COUNTESS. I think, sir, you can eat none of this homely meat.  CLOWN. O Lord, sir! Nay, put me to’t, I warrant you.  COUNTESS. You were lately whipp’d, sir, as I think.  CLOWN. O Lord, sir! Spare not me.  COUNTESS. Do you cry ‘O Lord, sir!’ at your whipping, and ‘spare not me’? Indeed your ‘O Lord, sir!’ is very sequent to your whipping. You would answer very well to a whipping, if you were but bound to’t.  CLOWN. I ne’er had worse luck in my life in my ‘O Lord, sir!’ I see things may serve long, but not serve ever.  COUNTESS. I play the noble housewife with the time, to entertain it so merrily with a fool.  CLOWN. O Lord, sir! Why, there’t serves well again.  COUNTESS. An end, sir! To your business. Give Helen this, And urge her to a present answer back. Commend me to my kinsmen and my son. This is not much.  CLOWN. Not much commendation to them?  COUNTESS. Not much employment for you. You understand me?  CLOWN. Most fruitfully. I am there before my legs.  COUNTESS. Haste you again.   [_Exeunt severally._]  SCENE III. Paris. The King’s palace.   Enter Bertram, Lafew and Parolles.  LAFEW. They say miracles are past; and we have our philosophical persons to make modern and familiar things supernatural and causeless. Hence is it that we make trifles of terrors, ensconcing ourselves into seeming knowledge when we should submit ourselves to an unknown fear.  PAROLLES. Why, ’tis the rarest argument of wonder that hath shot out in our latter times.  BERTRAM. And so ’tis.  LAFEW. To be relinquish’d of the artists,—  PAROLLES. So I say; both of Galen and Paracelsus.  LAFEW. Of all the learned and authentic fellows,—  PAROLLES. Right; so I say.  LAFEW. That gave him out incurable,—  PAROLLES. Why, there ’tis; so say I too.  LAFEW. Not to be helped.  PAROLLES. Right; as ’twere a man assur’d of a—  LAFEW. Uncertain life and sure death.  PAROLLES. Just; you say well. So would I have said.  LAFEW. I may truly say, it is a novelty to the world.  PAROLLES. It is indeed; if you will have it in showing, you shall read it in what do you call there?  LAFEW. A showing of a heavenly effect in an earthly actor.  PAROLLES. That’s it; I would have said the very same.  LAFEW. Why, your dolphin is not lustier; fore me, I speak in respect—  PAROLLES. Nay, ’tis strange, ’tis very strange; that is the brief and the tedious of it; and he’s of a most facinerious spirit that will not acknowledge it to be the—  LAFEW. Very hand of heaven.  PAROLLES. Ay, so I say.  LAFEW. In a most weak—  PAROLLES. And debile minister, great power, great transcendence, which should indeed give us a further use to be made than alone the recov’ry of the king, as to be—  LAFEW. Generally thankful.  PAROLLES. I would have said it; you say well. Here comes the king.   Enter King, Helena and Attendants.  LAFEW. Lustique, as the Dutchman says. I’ll like a maid the better, whilst I have a tooth in my head. Why, he’s able to lead her a coranto.  PAROLLES. _Mor du vinager!_ is not this Helen?  LAFEW. Fore God, I think so.  KING. Go, call before me all the lords in court.   [_Exit an Attendant._]  Sit, my preserver, by thy patient’s side, And with this healthful hand, whose banish’d sense Thou has repeal’d, a second time receive The confirmation of my promis’d gift, Which but attends thy naming.   Enter several Lords.  Fair maid, send forth thine eye. This youthful parcel Of noble bachelors stand at my bestowing, O’er whom both sovereign power and father’s voice I have to use. Thy frank election make; Thou hast power to choose, and they none to forsake.  HELENA. To each of you one fair and virtuous mistress Fall, when love please! Marry, to each but one!  LAFEW. I’d give bay curtal and his furniture My mouth no more were broken than these boys’, And writ as little beard.  KING. Peruse them well. Not one of those but had a noble father.   She addresses her to a Lord.  HELENA. Gentlemen, Heaven hath through me restor’d the king to health.  ALL. We understand it, and thank heaven for you.  HELENA. I am a simple maid, and therein wealthiest That I protest I simply am a maid. Please it, your majesty, I have done already. The blushes in my cheeks thus whisper me: “We blush that thou shouldst choose; but, be refused, Let the white death sit on thy cheek for ever, We’ll ne’er come there again.”  KING. Make choice; and, see, Who shuns thy love shuns all his love in me.  HELENA. Now, Dian, from thy altar do I fly, And to imperial Love, that god most high, Do my sighs stream. [_To first Lord._] Sir, will you hear my suit?  FIRST LORD. And grant it.  HELENA. Thanks, sir; all the rest is mute.  LAFEW. I had rather be in this choice than throw ames-ace for my life.  HELENA. [_To second Lord._] The honour, sir, that flames in your fair eyes, Before I speak, too threat’ningly replies. Love make your fortunes twenty times above Her that so wishes, and her humble love!  SECOND LORD. No better, if you please.  HELENA. My wish receive, Which great Love grant; and so I take my leave.  LAFEW. Do all they deny her? An they were sons of mine I’d have them whipp’d; or I would send them to th’ Turk to make eunuchs of.  HELENA. [_To third Lord._] Be not afraid that I your hand should take; I’ll never do you wrong for your own sake. Blessing upon your vows, and in your bed Find fairer fortune, if you ever wed!  LAFEW. These boys are boys of ice, they’ll none have her. Sure, they are bastards to the English; the French ne’er got ’em.  HELENA. [_To fourth Lord._] You are too young, too happy, and too good, To make yourself a son out of my blood.  FOURTH LORD. Fair one, I think not so.  LAFEW. There’s one grape yet. I am sure thy father drank wine. But if thou beest not an ass, I am a youth of fourteen; I have known thee already.  HELENA. [_To Bertram._] I dare not say I take you, but I give Me and my service, ever whilst I live, Into your guiding power. This is the man.  KING. Why, then, young Bertram, take her; she’s thy wife.  BERTRAM. My wife, my liege! I shall beseech your highness, In such a business give me leave to use The help of mine own eyes.  KING. Know’st thou not, Bertram, What she has done for me?  BERTRAM. Yes, my good lord, But never hope to know why I should marry her.  KING. Thou know’st she has rais’d me from my sickly bed.  BERTRAM. But follows it, my lord, to bring me down Must answer for your raising? I know her well; She had her breeding at my father’s charge: A poor physician’s daughter my wife! Disdain Rather corrupt me ever!  KING. ’Tis only title thou disdain’st in her, the which I can build up. Strange is it that our bloods, Of colour, weight, and heat, pour’d all together, Would quite confound distinction, yet stands off In differences so mighty. If she be All that is virtuous, save what thou dislik’st, A poor physician’s daughter,—thou dislik’st— Of virtue for the name. But do not so. From lowest place when virtuous things proceed, The place is dignified by the doer’s deed. Where great additions swell’s, and virtue none, It is a dropsied honour. Good alone Is good without a name; vileness is so: The property by what it is should go, Not by the title. She is young, wise, fair; In these to nature she’s immediate heir; And these breed honour: that is honour’s scorn Which challenges itself as honour’s born, And is not like the sire. Honours thrive When rather from our acts we them derive Than our fore-goers. The mere word’s a slave, Debauch’d on every tomb, on every grave A lying trophy, and as oft is dumb Where dust and damn’d oblivion is the tomb Of honour’d bones indeed. What should be said? If thou canst like this creature as a maid, I can create the rest. Virtue and she Is her own dower; honour and wealth from me.  BERTRAM. I cannot love her, nor will strive to do ’t.  KING. Thou wrong’st thyself, if thou shouldst strive to choose.  HELENA. That you are well restor’d, my lord, I am glad. Let the rest go.  KING. My honour’s at the stake, which to defeat, I must produce my power. Here, take her hand, Proud scornful boy, unworthy this good gift, That dost in vile misprision shackle up My love and her desert; that canst not dream We, poising us in her defective scale, Shall weigh thee to the beam; that wilt not know It is in us to plant thine honour where We please to have it grow. Check thy contempt; Obey our will, which travails in thy good; Believe not thy disdain, but presently Do thine own fortunes that obedient right Which both thy duty owes and our power claims; Or I will throw thee from my care for ever Into the staggers and the careless lapse Of youth and ignorance; both my revenge and hate Loosing upon thee in the name of justice, Without all terms of pity. Speak! Thine answer!  BERTRAM. Pardon, my gracious lord; for I submit My fancy to your eyes. When I consider What great creation, and what dole of honour Flies where you bid it, I find that she, which late Was in my nobler thoughts most base, is now The praised of the king; who, so ennobled, Is as ’twere born so.  KING. Take her by the hand, And tell her she is thine; to whom I promise A counterpoise; if not to thy estate, A balance more replete.  BERTRAM. I take her hand.  KING. Good fortune and the favour of the king Smile upon this contract; whose ceremony Shall seem expedient on the now-born brief, And be perform’d tonight. The solemn feast Shall more attend upon the coming space, Expecting absent friends. As thou lov’st her, Thy love’s to me religious; else, does err.   [_Exeunt King, Bertram, Helena, Lords, and Attendants._]  LAFEW. Do you hear, monsieur? A word with you.  PAROLLES. Your pleasure, sir.  LAFEW. Your lord and master did well to make his recantation.  PAROLLES. Recantation! My lord! My master!  LAFEW. Ay. Is it not a language I speak?  PAROLLES. A most harsh one, and not to be understood without bloody succeeding. My master!  LAFEW. Are you companion to the Count Rossillon?  PAROLLES. To any count; to all counts; to what is man.  LAFEW. To what is count’s man: count’s master is of another style.  PAROLLES. You are too old, sir; let it satisfy you, you are too old.  LAFEW. I must tell thee, sirrah, I write man; to which title age cannot bring thee.  PAROLLES. What I dare too well do, I dare not do.  LAFEW. I did think thee, for two ordinaries, to be a pretty wise fellow; thou didst make tolerable vent of thy travel; it might pass. Yet the scarfs and the bannerets about thee did manifoldly dissuade me from believing thee a vessel of too great a burden. I have now found thee; when I lose thee again I care not. Yet art thou good for nothing but taking up, and that thou art scarce worth.  PAROLLES. Hadst thou not the privilege of antiquity upon thee—  LAFEW. Do not plunge thyself too far in anger, lest thou hasten thy trial; which if—Lord have mercy on thee for a hen! So, my good window of lattice, fare thee well; thy casement I need not open, for I look through thee. Give me thy hand.  PAROLLES. My lord, you give me most egregious indignity.  LAFEW. Ay, with all my heart; and thou art worthy of it.  PAROLLES. I have not, my lord, deserv’d it.  LAFEW. Yes, good faith, every dram of it; and I will not bate thee a scruple.  PAROLLES. Well, I shall be wiser.  LAFEW. Ev’n as soon as thou canst, for thou hast to pull at a smack o’ th’ contrary. If ever thou beest bound in thy scarf and beaten, thou shalt find what it is to be proud of thy bondage. I have a desire to hold my acquaintance with thee, or rather my knowledge, that I may say in the default, “He is a man I know.”  PAROLLES. My lord, you do me most insupportable vexation.  LAFEW. I would it were hell-pains for thy sake, and my poor doing eternal; for doing I am past, as I will by thee, in what motion age will give me leave.   [_Exit._]  PAROLLES. Well, thou hast a son shall take this disgrace off me; scurvy, old, filthy, scurvy lord! Well, I must be patient; there is no fettering of authority. I’ll beat him, by my life, if I can meet him with any convenience, an he were double and double a lord. I’ll have no more pity of his age than I would have of—I’ll beat him, and if I could but meet him again.   Enter Lafew.  LAFEW. Sirrah, your lord and master’s married; there’s news for you; you have a new mistress.  PAROLLES. I most unfeignedly beseech your lordship to make some reservation of your wrongs. He is my good lord; whom I serve above is my master.  LAFEW. Who? God?  PAROLLES. Ay, sir.  LAFEW. The devil it is that’s thy master. Why dost thou garter up thy arms o’ this fashion? Dost make hose of thy sleeves? Do other servants so? Thou wert best set thy lower part where thy nose stands. By mine honour, if I were but two hours younger, I’d beat thee. Methink’st thou art a general offence, and every man should beat thee. I think thou wast created for men to breathe themselves upon thee.  PAROLLES. This is hard and undeserved measure, my lord.  LAFEW. Go to, sir; you were beaten in Italy for picking a kernel out of a pomegranate; you are a vagabond, and no true traveller. You are more saucy with lords and honourable personages than the commission of your birth and virtue gives you heraldry. You are not worth another word, else I’d call you knave. I leave you.   [_Exit._]   Enter Bertram.  PAROLLES. Good, very good, it is so then. Good, very good; let it be conceal’d awhile.  BERTRAM. Undone, and forfeited to cares for ever!  PAROLLES. What’s the matter, sweetheart?  BERTRAM. Although before the solemn priest I have sworn, I will not bed her.  PAROLLES. What, what, sweetheart?  BERTRAM. O my Parolles, they have married me! I’ll to the Tuscan wars, and never bed her.  PAROLLES. France is a dog-hole, and it no more merits The tread of a man’s foot: to the wars!  BERTRAM. There’s letters from my mother; what th’ import is I know not yet.  PAROLLES. Ay, that would be known. To th’ wars, my boy, to th’ wars! He wears his honour in a box unseen That hugs his kicky-wicky here at home, Spending his manly marrow in her arms, Which should sustain the bound and high curvet Of Mars’s fiery steed. To other regions! France is a stable; we that dwell in’t, jades, Therefore, to th’ war!  BERTRAM. It shall be so; I’ll send her to my house, Acquaint my mother with my hate to her, And wherefore I am fled; write to the king That which I durst not speak. His present gift Shall furnish me to those Italian fields Where noble fellows strike. War is no strife To the dark house and the detested wife.  PAROLLES. Will this caprichio hold in thee, art sure?  BERTRAM. Go with me to my chamber and advise me. I’ll send her straight away. Tomorrow I’ll to the wars, she to her single sorrow.  PAROLLES. Why, these balls bound; there’s noise in it. ’Tis hard: A young man married is a man that’s marr’d. Therefore away, and leave her bravely; go. The king has done you wrong; but hush ’tis so.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE IV. Paris. The King’s palace.   Enter Helena and Clown.  HELENA. My mother greets me kindly: is she well?  CLOWN. She is not well, but yet she has her health; she’s very merry, but yet she is not well. But thanks be given, she’s very well, and wants nothing i’ the world; but yet she is not well.  HELENA. If she be very well, what does she ail that she’s not very well?  CLOWN. Truly, she’s very well indeed, but for two things.  HELENA. What two things?  CLOWN. One, that she’s not in heaven, whither God send her quickly! The other, that she’s in earth, from whence God send her quickly!   Enter Parolles.  PAROLLES. Bless you, my fortunate lady!  HELENA. I hope, sir, I have your good will to have mine own good fortune.  PAROLLES. You had my prayers to lead them on; and to keep them on, have them still. O, my knave how does my old lady?  CLOWN. So that you had her wrinkles and I her money, I would she did as you say.  PAROLLES. Why, I say nothing.  CLOWN. Marry, you are the wiser man; for many a man’s tongue shakes out his master’s undoing. To say nothing, to do nothing, to know nothing, and to have nothing, is to be a great part of your title; which is within a very little of nothing.  PAROLLES. Away! Thou art a knave.  CLOWN. You should have said, sir, before a knave thou art a knave; that is before me thou art a knave. This had been truth, sir.  PAROLLES. Go to, thou art a witty fool; I have found thee.  CLOWN. Did you find me in yourself, sir? or were you taught to find me? The search, sir, was profitable; and much fool may you find in you, even to the world’s pleasure and the increase of laughter.  PAROLLES. A good knave, i’ faith, and well fed. Madam, my lord will go away tonight; A very serious business calls on him. The great prerogative and right of love, Which, as your due, time claims, he does acknowledge; But puts it off to a compell’d restraint; Whose want, and whose delay, is strew’d with sweets; Which they distil now in the curbed time, To make the coming hour o’erflow with joy And pleasure drown the brim.  HELENA. What’s his will else?  PAROLLES. That you will take your instant leave o’ the king, And make this haste as your own good proceeding, Strengthen’d with what apology you think May make it probable need.  HELENA. What more commands he?  PAROLLES. That, having this obtain’d, you presently Attend his further pleasure.  HELENA. In everything I wait upon his will.  PAROLLES. I shall report it so.  HELENA. I pray you. Come, sirrah.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE V. Another room in the same.   Enter Lafew and Bertram.  LAFEW. But I hope your lordship thinks not him a soldier.  BERTRAM. Yes, my lord, and of very valiant approof.  LAFEW. You have it from his own deliverance.  BERTRAM. And by other warranted testimony.  LAFEW. Then my dial goes not true; I took this lark for a bunting.  BERTRAM. I do assure you, my lord, he is very great in knowledge, and accordingly valiant.  LAFEW. I have, then, sinned against his experience and transgressed against his valour; and my state that way is dangerous, since I cannot yet find in my heart to repent. Here he comes; I pray you make us friends; I will pursue the amity   Enter Parolles.  PAROLLES. [_To Bertram._] These things shall be done, sir.  LAFEW. Pray you, sir, who’s his tailor?  PAROLLES. Sir!  LAFEW. O, I know him well, I, sir; he, sir, is a good workman, a very good tailor.  BERTRAM. [_Aside to Parolles._] Is she gone to the king?  PAROLLES. She is.  BERTRAM. Will she away tonight?  PAROLLES. As you’ll have her.  BERTRAM. I have writ my letters, casketed my treasure, Given order for our horses; and tonight, When I should take possession of the bride, End ere I do begin.  LAFEW. A good traveller is something at the latter end of a dinner; but one that lies three-thirds and uses a known truth to pass a thousand nothings with, should be once heard and thrice beaten.— God save you, Captain.  BERTRAM. Is there any unkindness between my lord and you, monsieur?  PAROLLES. I know not how I have deserved to run into my lord’s displeasure.  LAFEW. You have made shift to run into ’t, boots and spurs and all, like him that leapt into the custard; and out of it you’ll run again, rather than suffer question for your residence.  BERTRAM. It may be you have mistaken him, my lord.  LAFEW. And shall do so ever, though I took him at his prayers. Fare you well, my lord; and believe this of me, there can be no kernal in this light nut; the soul of this man is his clothes; trust him not in matter of heavy consequence; I have kept of them tame, and know their natures. Farewell, monsieur; I have spoken better of you than you have or will to deserve at my hand; but we must do good against evil.   [_Exit._]  PAROLLES. An idle lord, I swear.  BERTRAM. I think so.  PAROLLES. Why, do you not know him?  BERTRAM. Yes, I do know him well; and common speech Gives him a worthy pass. Here comes my clog.   Enter Helena.  HELENA. I have, sir, as I was commanded from you, Spoke with the king, and have procur’d his leave For present parting; only he desires Some private speech with you.  BERTRAM. I shall obey his will. You must not marvel, Helen, at my course, Which holds not colour with the time, nor does The ministration and required office On my particular. Prepared I was not For such a business; therefore am I found So much unsettled: this drives me to entreat you; That presently you take your way for home, And rather muse than ask why I entreat you: For my respects are better than they seem; And my appointments have in them a need Greater than shows itself at the first view To you that know them not. This to my mother.   [_Giving a letter._]  ’Twill be two days ere I shall see you; so I leave you to your wisdom.  HELENA. Sir, I can nothing say But that I am your most obedient servant.  BERTRAM. Come, come, no more of that.  HELENA. And ever shall With true observance seek to eke out that Wherein toward me my homely stars have fail’d To equal my great fortune.  BERTRAM. Let that go. My haste is very great. Farewell; hie home.  HELENA. Pray, sir, your pardon.  BERTRAM. Well, what would you say?  HELENA. I am not worthy of the wealth I owe; Nor dare I say ’tis mine, and yet it is; But, like a timorous thief, most fain would steal What law does vouch mine own.  BERTRAM. What would you have?  HELENA. Something; and scarce so much; nothing indeed. I would not tell you what I would, my lord. Faith, yes, Strangers and foes do sunder and not kiss.  BERTRAM. I pray you, stay not, but in haste to horse.  HELENA. I shall not break your bidding, good my lord. Where are my other men, monsieur? Farewell,   [_Exit Helena._]  BERTRAM. Go thou toward home, where I will never come Whilst I can shake my sword or hear the drum. Away, and for our flight.  PAROLLES. Bravely, coragio!   [_Exeunt._]   ACT III.  SCENE I. Florence. A room in the Duke’s palace.   Flourish. Enter the Duke of Florence attended; two French Lords, and  Soldiers.  DUKE. So that, from point to point, now have you heard The fundamental reasons of this war, Whose great decision hath much blood let forth, And more thirsts after.  FIRST LORD. Holy seems the quarrel Upon your Grace’s part; black and fearful On the opposer.  DUKE. Therefore we marvel much our cousin France Would, in so just a business, shut his bosom Against our borrowing prayers.  SECOND LORD. Good my lord, The reasons of our state I cannot yield, But like a common and an outward man That the great figure of a council frames By self-unable motion; therefore dare not Say what I think of it, since I have found Myself in my incertain grounds to fail As often as I guess’d.  DUKE. Be it his pleasure.  FIRST LORD. But I am sure the younger of our nature, That surfeit on their ease, will day by day Come here for physic.  DUKE. Welcome shall they be; And all the honours that can fly from us Shall on them settle. You know your places well; When better fall, for your avails they fell. Tomorrow to the field.   [_Flourish. Exeunt._]  SCENE II. Rossillon. A room in the Countess’s palace.   Enter Countess and Clown.  COUNTESS. It hath happen’d all as I would have had it, save that he comes not along with her.  CLOWN. By my troth, I take my young lord to be a very melancholy man.  COUNTESS. By what observance, I pray you?  CLOWN. Why, he will look upon his boot and sing; mend the ruff and sing; ask questions and sing; pick his teeth and sing. I know a man that had this trick of melancholy sold a goodly manor for a song.  COUNTESS. Let me see what he writes, and when he means to come.   [_Opening a letter._]  CLOWN. I have no mind to Isbel since I was at court. Our old lings and our Isbels o’ th’ country are nothing like your old ling and your Isbels o’ th’ court. The brains of my Cupid’s knock’d out, and I begin to love, as an old man loves money, with no stomach.  COUNTESS. What have we here?  CLOWN. E’en that you have there.   [_Exit._]  COUNTESS. [_Reads._] _I have sent you a daughter-in-law; she hath recovered the king and undone me. I have wedded her, not bedded her, and sworn to make the “not” eternal. You shall hear I am run away; know it before the report come. If there be breadth enough in the world, I will hold a long distance. My duty to you.               Your unfortunate son,_                             BERTRAM.  This is not well, rash and unbridled boy, To fly the favours of so good a king, To pluck his indignation on thy head By the misprizing of a maid too virtuous For the contempt of empire.   Enter Clown.  CLOWN. O madam, yonder is heavy news within between two soldiers and my young lady.  COUNTESS. What is the matter?  CLOWN. Nay, there is some comfort in the news, some comfort; your son will not be kill’d so soon as I thought he would.  COUNTESS. Why should he be kill’d?  CLOWN. So say I, madam, if he run away, as I hear he does; the danger is in standing to’t; that’s the loss of men, though it be the getting of children. Here they come will tell you more. For my part, I only hear your son was run away.   [_Exit._]   Enter Helena and the two Gentlemen.  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Save you, good madam.  HELENA. Madam, my lord is gone, for ever gone.  SECOND GENTLEMAN. Do not say so.  COUNTESS. Think upon patience. Pray you, gentlemen,— I have felt so many quirks of joy and grief That the first face of neither on the start Can woman me unto ’t. Where is my son, I pray you?  SECOND GENTLEMAN. Madam, he’s gone to serve the Duke of Florence; We met him thitherward, for thence we came, And, after some despatch in hand at court, Thither we bend again.  HELENA. Look on this letter, madam; here’s my passport.  [_Reads._] _When thou canst get the ring upon my finger, which never shall come off, and show me a child begotten of thy body that I am father to, then call me husband; but in such a “then” I write a “never”._ This is a dreadful sentence.  COUNTESS. Brought you this letter, gentlemen?  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Ay, madam; And for the contents’ sake, are sorry for our pains.  COUNTESS. I pr’ythee, lady, have a better cheer; If thou engrossest all the griefs are thine, Thou robb’st me of a moiety. He was my son, But I do wash his name out of my blood, And thou art all my child. Towards Florence is he?  SECOND GENTLEMAN. Ay, madam.  COUNTESS. And to be a soldier?  SECOND GENTLEMAN. Such is his noble purpose, and, believe’t, The duke will lay upon him all the honour That good convenience claims.  COUNTESS. Return you thither?  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Ay, madam, with the swiftest wing of speed.  HELENA. [_Reads._] _Till I have no wife, I have nothing in France._ ’Tis bitter.  COUNTESS. Find you that there?  HELENA. Ay, madam.  FIRST GENTLEMAN. ’Tis but the boldness of his hand haply, which his heart was not consenting to.  COUNTESS. Nothing in France until he have no wife! There’s nothing here that is too good for him But only she, and she deserves a lord That twenty such rude boys might tend upon, And call her hourly mistress. Who was with him?  FIRST GENTLEMAN. A servant only, and a gentleman which I have sometime known.  COUNTESS. Parolles, was it not?  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Ay, my good lady, he.  COUNTESS. A very tainted fellow, and full of wickedness. My son corrupts a well-derived nature With his inducement.  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Indeed, good lady, The fellow has a deal of that too much, Which holds him much to have.  COUNTESS. Y’are welcome, gentlemen. I will entreat you, when you see my son, To tell him that his sword can never win The honour that he loses: more I’ll entreat you Written to bear along.  SECOND GENTLEMAN. We serve you, madam, In that and all your worthiest affairs.  COUNTESS. Not so, but as we change our courtesies. Will you draw near?   [_Exeunt Countess and Gentlemen._]  HELENA. “Till I have no wife, I have nothing in France.” Nothing in France until he has no wife! Thou shalt have none, Rossillon, none in France; Then hast thou all again. Poor lord, is’t I That chase thee from thy country, and expose Those tender limbs of thine to the event Of the none-sparing war? And is it I That drive thee from the sportive court, where thou Wast shot at with fair eyes, to be the mark Of smoky muskets? O you leaden messengers, That ride upon the violent speed of fire, Fly with false aim; move the still-peering air, That sings with piercing; do not touch my lord. Whoever shoots at him, I set him there; Whoever charges on his forward breast, I am the caitiff that do hold him to’t; And though I kill him not, I am the cause His death was so effected. Better ’twere I met the ravin lion when he roar’d With sharp constraint of hunger; better ’twere That all the miseries which nature owes Were mine at once. No; come thou home, Rossillon, Whence honour but of danger wins a scar, As oft it loses all. I will be gone; My being here it is that holds thee hence. Shall I stay here to do’t? No, no, although The air of paradise did fan the house, And angels offic’d all. I will be gone, That pitiful rumour may report my flight To consolate thine ear. Come, night; end, day; For with the dark, poor thief, I’ll steal away.   [_Exit._]  SCENE III. Florence. Before the Duke’s palace.   Flourish. Enter the Duke of Florence, Bertram, drum and trumpets,  Soldiers, Parolles.  DUKE. The general of our horse thou art, and we, Great in our hope, lay our best love and credence Upon thy promising fortune.  BERTRAM. Sir, it is A charge too heavy for my strength; but yet We’ll strive to bear it for your worthy sake To th’extreme edge of hazard.  DUKE. Then go thou forth; And fortune play upon thy prosperous helm, As thy auspicious mistress!  BERTRAM. This very day, Great Mars, I put myself into thy file; Make me but like my thoughts, and I shall prove A lover of thy drum, hater of love.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE IV. Rossillon. A room in the Countess’s palace.   Enter Countess and Steward.  COUNTESS. Alas! and would you take the letter of her? Might you not know she would do as she has done, By sending me a letter? Read it again.  STEWARD. [_Reads._] _I am Saint Jaques’ pilgrim, thither gone. Ambitious love hath so in me offended That barefoot plod I the cold ground upon, With sainted vow my faults to have amended. Write, write, that from the bloody course of war My dearest master, your dear son, may hie. Bless him at home in peace, whilst I from far His name with zealous fervour sanctify. His taken labours bid him me forgive; I, his despiteful Juno, sent him forth From courtly friends, with camping foes to live, Where death and danger dog the heels of worth. He is too good and fair for death and me; Whom I myself embrace to set him free._  COUNTESS. Ah, what sharp stings are in her mildest words! Rynaldo, you did never lack advice so much As letting her pass so; had I spoke with her, I could have well diverted her intents, Which thus she hath prevented.  STEWARD. Pardon me, madam; If I had given you this at over-night, She might have been o’erta’en; and yet she writes Pursuit would be but vain.  COUNTESS. What angel shall Bless this unworthy husband? He cannot thrive, Unless her prayers, whom heaven delights to hear And loves to grant, reprieve him from the wrath Of greatest justice. Write, write, Rynaldo, To this unworthy husband of his wife; Let every word weigh heavy of her worth, That he does weigh too light; my greatest grief, Though little he do feel it, set down sharply. Dispatch the most convenient messenger. When haply he shall hear that she is gone He will return; and hope I may that she, Hearing so much, will speed her foot again, Led hither by pure love. Which of them both Is dearest to me I have no skill in sense To make distinction. Provide this messenger. My heart is heavy, and mine age is weak; Grief would have tears, and sorrow bids me speak.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE V. Without the walls of Florence.   Enter an old Widow of Florence, Diana, Violenta, Mariana and other  Citizens.  WIDOW. Nay, come; for if they do approach the city, we shall lose all the sight.  DIANA. They say the French count has done most honourable service.  WIDOW. It is reported that he has taken their great’st commander, and that with his own hand he slew the duke’s brother.   [_A tucket afar off._]  We have lost our labour; they are gone a contrary way. Hark! you may know by their trumpets.  MARIANA. Come, let’s return again, and suffice ourselves with the report of it. Well, Diana, take heed of this French earl; the honour of a maid is her name; and no legacy is so rich as honesty.  WIDOW. I have told my neighbour how you have been solicited by a gentleman his companion.  MARIANA. I know that knave; hang him! one Parolles; a filthy officer he is in those suggestions for the young earl. Beware of them, Diana; their promises, enticements, oaths, tokens, and all these engines of lust, are not the things they go under; many a maid hath been seduced by them; and the misery is, example, that so terrible shows in the wreck of maidenhood, cannot for all that dissuade succession, but that they are limed with the twigs that threaten them. I hope I need not to advise you further; but I hope your own grace will keep you where you are, though there were no further danger known but the modesty which is so lost.  DIANA. You shall not need to fear me.   Enter Helena in the dress of a pilgrim.  WIDOW. I hope so. Look, here comes a pilgrim. I know she will lie at my house; thither they send one another; I’ll question her. God save you, pilgrim! Whither are bound?  HELENA. To Saint Jaques le Grand. Where do the palmers lodge, I do beseech you?  WIDOW. At the Saint Francis here, beside the port.  HELENA. Is this the way?   [_A march afar._]  WIDOW. Ay, marry, is’t. Hark you, they come this way. If you will tarry, holy pilgrim, But till the troops come by, I will conduct you where you shall be lodg’d; The rather for I think I know your hostess As ample as myself.  HELENA. Is it yourself?  WIDOW. If you shall please so, pilgrim.  HELENA. I thank you, and will stay upon your leisure.  WIDOW. You came, I think, from France?  HELENA. I did so.  WIDOW. Here you shall see a countryman of yours That has done worthy service.  HELENA. His name, I pray you.  DIANA. The Count Rossillon. Know you such a one?  HELENA. But by the ear, that hears most nobly of him; His face I know not.  DIANA. Whatsome’er he is, He’s bravely taken here. He stole from France, As ’tis reported, for the king had married him Against his liking. Think you it is so?  HELENA. Ay, surely, mere the truth; I know his lady.  DIANA. There is a gentleman that serves the count Reports but coarsely of her.  HELENA. What’s his name?  DIANA. Monsieur Parolles.  HELENA. O, I believe with him, In argument of praise, or to the worth Of the great count himself, she is too mean To have her name repeated; all her deserving Is a reserved honesty, and that I have not heard examin’d.  DIANA. Alas, poor lady! ’Tis a hard bondage to become the wife Of a detesting lord.  WIDOW. Ay, right; good creature, wheresoe’er she is, Her heart weighs sadly. This young maid might do her A shrewd turn, if she pleas’d.  HELENA. How do you mean? Maybe the amorous count solicits her In the unlawful purpose.  WIDOW. He does indeed, And brokes with all that can in such a suit Corrupt the tender honour of a maid; But she is arm’d for him, and keeps her guard In honestest defence.   Enter, with a drum and colours, a party of the Florentine army,  Bertram and Parolles.  MARIANA. The gods forbid else!  WIDOW. So, now they come. That is Antonio, the Duke’s eldest son; That Escalus.  HELENA. Which is the Frenchman?  DIANA. He; That with the plume; ’tis a most gallant fellow. I would he lov’d his wife; if he were honester He were much goodlier. Is’t not a handsome gentleman?  HELENA. I like him well.  DIANA. ’Tis pity he is not honest. Yond’s that same knave That leads him to these places. Were I his lady I would poison that vile rascal.  HELENA. Which is he?  DIANA. That jack-an-apes with scarfs. Why is he melancholy?  HELENA. Perchance he’s hurt i’ the battle.  PAROLLES. Lose our drum! Well.  MARIANA. He’s shrewdly vex’d at something. Look, he has spied us.  WIDOW. Marry, hang you!  MARIANA. And your courtesy, for a ring-carrier!   [_Exeunt Bertram, Parolles, Officers and Soldiers._]  WIDOW. The troop is past. Come, pilgrim, I will bring you Where you shall host; of enjoin’d penitents There’s four or five, to great Saint Jaques bound, Already at my house.  HELENA. I humbly thank you. Please it this matron and this gentle maid To eat with us tonight; the charge and thanking Shall be for me; and, to requite you further, I will bestow some precepts of this virgin, Worthy the note.  BOTH. We’ll take your offer kindly.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE VI. Camp before Florence.   Enter Bertram and the two French Lords.  FIRST LORD. Nay, good my lord, put him to’t; let him have his way.  SECOND LORD. If your lordship find him not a hilding, hold me no more in your respect.  FIRST LORD. On my life, my lord, a bubble.  BERTRAM. Do you think I am so far deceived in him?  FIRST LORD. Believe it, my lord, in mine own direct knowledge, without any malice, but to speak of him as my kinsman, he’s a most notable coward, an infinite and endless liar, an hourly promise-breaker, the owner of no one good quality worthy your lordship’s entertainment.  SECOND LORD. It were fit you knew him; lest, reposing too far in his virtue, which he hath not, he might at some great and trusty business, in a main danger fail you.  BERTRAM. I would I knew in what particular action to try him.  SECOND LORD. None better than to let him fetch off his drum, which you hear him so confidently undertake to do.  FIRST LORD. I with a troop of Florentines will suddenly surprise him; such I will have whom I am sure he knows not from the enemy; we will bind and hoodwink him so that he shall suppose no other but that he is carried into the leaguer of the adversaries when we bring him to our own tents. Be but your lordship present at his examination; if he do not for the promise of his life, and in the highest compulsion of base fear, offer to betray you, and deliver all the intelligence in his power against you, and that with the divine forfeit of his soul upon oath, never trust my judgment in anything.  SECOND LORD. O, for the love of laughter, let him fetch his drum; he says he has a stratagem for’t. When your lordship sees the bottom of his success in’t, and to what metal this counterfeit lump of ore will be melted, if you give him not John Drum’s entertainment, your inclining cannot be removed. Here he comes.   Enter Parolles.  FIRST LORD. O, for the love of laughter, hinder not the honour of his design: let him fetch off his drum in any hand.  BERTRAM. How now, monsieur! This drum sticks sorely in your disposition.  SECOND LORD. A pox on ’t; let it go; ’tis but a drum.  PAROLLES. But a drum! Is’t but a drum? A drum so lost! There was excellent command, to charge in with our horse upon our own wings, and to rend our own soldiers.  SECOND LORD. That was not to be blam’d in the command of the service; it was a disaster of war that Caesar himself could not have prevented, if he had been there to command.  BERTRAM. Well, we cannot greatly condemn our success: some dishonour we had in the loss of that drum, but it is not to be recovered.  PAROLLES. It might have been recovered.  BERTRAM. It might, but it is not now.  PAROLLES. It is to be recovered. But that the merit of service is seldom attributed to the true and exact performer, I would have that drum or another, or _hic jacet_.  BERTRAM. Why, if you have a stomach, to’t, monsieur, if you think your mystery in stratagem can bring this instrument of honour again into his native quarter, be magnanimous in the enterprise, and go on; I will grace the attempt for a worthy exploit; if you speed well in it, the duke shall both speak of it and extend to you what further becomes his greatness, even to the utmost syllable of your worthiness.  PAROLLES. By the hand of a soldier, I will undertake it.  BERTRAM. But you must not now slumber in it.  PAROLLES. I’ll about it this evening; and I will presently pen down my dilemmas, encourage myself in my certainty, put myself into my mortal preparation; and by midnight look to hear further from me.  BERTRAM. May I be bold to acquaint his grace you are gone about it?  PAROLLES. I know not what the success will be, my lord, but the attempt I vow.  BERTRAM. I know th’art valiant; and to the possibility of thy soldiership, will subscribe for thee. Farewell.  PAROLLES. I love not many words.   [_Exit._]  FIRST LORD. No more than a fish loves water. Is not this a strange fellow, my lord, that so confidently seems to undertake this business, which he knows is not to be done; damns himself to do, and dares better be damn’d than to do’t.  SECOND LORD. You do not know him, my lord, as we do; certain it is that he will steal himself into a man’s favour, and for a week escape a great deal of discoveries, but when you find him out, you have him ever after.  BERTRAM. Why, do you think he will make no deed at all of this, that so seriously he does address himself unto?  FIRST LORD. None in the world; but return with an invention, and clap upon you two or three probable lies; but we have almost embossed him; you shall see his fall tonight; for indeed he is not for your lordship’s respect.  SECOND LORD. We’ll make you some sport with the fox ere we case him. He was first smok’d by the old Lord Lafew; when his disguise and he is parted, tell me what a sprat you shall find him; which you shall see this very night.  FIRST LORD. I must go look my twigs. He shall be caught.  BERTRAM. Your brother, he shall go along with me.  FIRST LORD. As’t please your lordship. I’ll leave you.   [_Exit._]  BERTRAM. Now will I lead you to the house, and show you The lass I spoke of.  SECOND LORD. But you say she’s honest.  BERTRAM. That’s all the fault. I spoke with her but once, And found her wondrous cold, but I sent to her By this same coxcomb that we have i’ the wind Tokens and letters which she did re-send, And this is all I have done. She’s a fair creature; Will you go see her?  SECOND LORD. With all my heart, my lord.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE VII. Florence. A room in the Widow’s house.   Enter Helena and Widow.  HELENA. If you misdoubt me that I am not she, I know not how I shall assure you further, But I shall lose the grounds I work upon.  WIDOW. Though my estate be fall’n, I was well born, Nothing acquainted with these businesses, And would not put my reputation now In any staining act.  HELENA. Nor would I wish you. First give me trust, the count he is my husband, And what to your sworn counsel I have spoken Is so from word to word; and then you cannot, By the good aid that I of you shall borrow, Err in bestowing it.  WIDOW. I should believe you, For you have show’d me that which well approves Y’are great in fortune.  HELENA. Take this purse of gold, And let me buy your friendly help thus far, Which I will over-pay, and pay again When I have found it. The count he woos your daughter Lays down his wanton siege before her beauty, Resolv’d to carry her; let her in fine consent, As we’ll direct her how ’tis best to bear it. Now his important blood will naught deny That she’ll demand; a ring the county wears, That downward hath succeeded in his house From son to son, some four or five descents Since the first father wore it. This ring he holds In most rich choice; yet, in his idle fire, To buy his will, it would not seem too dear, Howe’er repented after.  WIDOW. Now I see The bottom of your purpose.  HELENA. You see it lawful then; it is no more But that your daughter, ere she seems as won, Desires this ring; appoints him an encounter; In fine, delivers me to fill the time, Herself most chastely absent. After, To marry her, I’ll add three thousand crowns To what is pass’d already.  WIDOW. I have yielded. Instruct my daughter how she shall persever, That time and place with this deceit so lawful May prove coherent. Every night he comes With musics of all sorts, and songs compos’d To her unworthiness: it nothing steads us To chide him from our eaves; for he persists As if his life lay on ’t.  HELENA. Why then tonight Let us assay our plot; which, if it speed, Is wicked meaning in a lawful deed, And lawful meaning in a lawful act, Where both not sin, and yet a sinful fact. But let’s about it.   [_Exeunt._]   ACT IV.  SCENE I. Without the Florentine camp.   Enter first Lord with five or six Soldiers in ambush.  FIRST LORD. He can come no other way but by this hedge-corner. When you sally upon him, speak what terrible language you will; though you understand it not yourselves, no matter; for we must not seem to understand him, unless someone among us, whom we must produce for an interpreter.  FIRST SOLDIER. Good captain, let me be th’ interpreter.  FIRST LORD. Art not acquainted with him? Knows he not thy voice?  FIRST SOLDIER. No sir, I warrant you.  FIRST LORD. But what linsey-woolsey has thou to speak to us again?  FIRST SOLDIER. E’en such as you speak to me.  FIRST LORD. He must think us some band of strangers i’ the adversary’s entertainment. Now he hath a smack of all neighbouring languages, therefore we must every one be a man of his own fancy; not to know what we speak one to another, so we seem to know, is to know straight our purpose: choughs’ language, gabble enough, and good enough. As for you, interpreter, you must seem very politic. But couch, ho! Here he comes; to beguile two hours in a sleep, and then to return and swear the lies he forges.   Enter Parolles.  PAROLLES. Ten o’clock. Within these three hours ’twill be time enough to go home. What shall I say I have done? It must be a very plausive invention that carries it. They begin to smoke me, and disgraces have of late knock’d too often at my door. I find my tongue is too foolhardy, but my heart hath the fear of Mars before it, and of his creatures, not daring the reports of my tongue.  FIRST LORD. [_Aside._] This is the first truth that e’er thine own tongue was guilty of.  PAROLLES. What the devil should move me to undertake the recovery of this drum, being not ignorant of the impossibility, and knowing I had no such purpose? I must give myself some hurts, and say I got them in exploit; yet slight ones will not carry it. They will say “Came you off with so little?” and great ones I dare not give. Wherefore, what’s the instance? Tongue, I must put you into a butter-woman’s mouth, and buy myself another of Bajazet’s mule, if you prattle me into these perils.  FIRST LORD. [_Aside._] Is it possible he should know what he is, and be that he is?  PAROLLES. I would the cutting of my garments would serve the turn, or the breaking of my Spanish sword.  FIRST LORD. [_Aside._] We cannot afford you so.  PAROLLES. Or the baring of my beard, and to say it was in stratagem.  FIRST LORD. [_Aside._] ’Twould not do.  PAROLLES. Or to drown my clothes, and say I was stripped.  FIRST LORD. [_Aside._] Hardly serve.  PAROLLES. Though I swore I leap’d from the window of the citadel,—  FIRST LORD. [_Aside._] How deep?  PAROLLES. Thirty fathom.  FIRST LORD. [_Aside._] Three great oaths would scarce make that be believed.  PAROLLES. I would I had any drum of the enemy’s; I would swear I recover’d it.  FIRST LORD. [_Aside._] You shall hear one anon.  PAROLLES. A drum now of the enemy’s!   [_Alarum within._]  FIRST LORD. _Throca movousus, cargo, cargo, cargo._  ALL. _Cargo, cargo, cargo, villianda par corbo, cargo._   [_They seize and blindfold him._]  PAROLLES. O, ransom, ransom! Do not hide mine eyes.  FIRST SOLDIER. _Boskos thromuldo boskos._  PAROLLES. I know you are the Muskos’ regiment, And I shall lose my life for want of language. If there be here German, or Dane, Low Dutch, Italian, or French, let him speak to me, I’ll discover that which shall undo the Florentine.  FIRST SOLDIER. _Boskos vauvado._ I understand thee, and can speak thy tongue. _Kerelybonto._ Sir, Betake thee to thy faith, for seventeen poniards are at thy bosom.  PAROLLES. O!  FIRST SOLDIER. O, pray, pray, pray! _Manka revania dulche._  FIRST LORD. _Oscorbidulchos volivorco._  FIRST SOLDIER. The General is content to spare thee yet; And, hoodwink’d as thou art, will lead thee on To gather from thee. Haply thou mayst inform Something to save thy life.  PAROLLES. O, let me live, And all the secrets of our camp I’ll show, Their force, their purposes; nay, I’ll speak that Which you will wonder at.  FIRST SOLDIER. But wilt thou faithfully?  PAROLLES. If I do not, damn me.  FIRST SOLDIER. _Acordo linta._ Come on; thou art granted space.   [_Exit, with Parolles guarded._]   A short alarum within.  FIRST LORD. Go tell the Count Rossillon and my brother We have caught the woodcock, and will keep him muffled Till we do hear from them.  SECOND SOLDIER. Captain, I will.  FIRST LORD. ’A will betray us all unto ourselves; Inform on that.  SECOND SOLDIER. So I will, sir.  FIRST LORD. Till then I’ll keep him dark, and safely lock’d.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE II. Florence. A room in the Widow’s house.   Enter Bertram and Diana.  BERTRAM. They told me that your name was Fontybell.  DIANA. No, my good lord, Diana.  BERTRAM. Titled goddess; And worth it, with addition! But, fair soul, In your fine frame hath love no quality? If the quick fire of youth light not your mind, You are no maiden but a monument; When you are dead, you should be such a one As you are now; for you are cold and stern, And now you should be as your mother was When your sweet self was got.  DIANA. She then was honest.  BERTRAM. So should you be.  DIANA. No. My mother did but duty; such, my lord, As you owe to your wife.  BERTRAM. No more a’ that! I pr’ythee do not strive against my vows; I was compell’d to her; but I love thee By love’s own sweet constraint, and will for ever Do thee all rights of service.  DIANA. Ay, so you serve us Till we serve you; but when you have our roses, You barely leave our thorns to prick ourselves, And mock us with our bareness.  BERTRAM. How have I sworn?  DIANA. ’Tis not the many oaths that makes the truth, But the plain single vow that is vow’d true. What is not holy, that we swear not by, But take the highest to witness: then, pray you, tell me, If I should swear by Jove’s great attributes I lov’d you dearly, would you believe my oaths When I did love you ill? This has no holding, To swear by him whom I protest to love That I will work against him. Therefore your oaths Are words and poor conditions; but unseal’d,— At least in my opinion.  BERTRAM. Change it, change it. Be not so holy-cruel. Love is holy; And my integrity ne’er knew the crafts That you do charge men with. Stand no more off, But give thyself unto my sick desires, Who then recovers. Say thou art mine, and ever My love as it begins shall so persever.  DIANA. I see that men make hopes in such a case, That we’ll forsake ourselves. Give me that ring.  BERTRAM. I’ll lend it thee, my dear, but have no power To give it from me.  DIANA. Will you not, my lord?  BERTRAM. It is an honour ’longing to our house, Bequeathed down from many ancestors, Which were the greatest obloquy i’ the world In me to lose.  DIANA. Mine honour’s such a ring; My chastity’s the jewel of our house, Bequeathed down from many ancestors, Which were the greatest obloquy i’ the world In me to lose. Thus your own proper wisdom Brings in the champion honour on my part Against your vain assault.  BERTRAM. Here, take my ring; My house, mine honour, yea, my life be thine, And I’ll be bid by thee.  DIANA. When midnight comes, knock at my chamber window; I’ll order take my mother shall not hear. Now will I charge you in the band of truth, When you have conquer’d my yet maiden-bed, Remain there but an hour, nor speak to me. My reasons are most strong; and you shall know them When back again this ring shall be deliver’d; And on your finger in the night, I’ll put Another ring, that what in time proceeds May token to the future our past deeds. Adieu till then; then fail not. You have won A wife of me, though there my hope be done.  BERTRAM. A heaven on earth I have won by wooing thee.   [_Exit._]  DIANA. For which live long to thank both heaven and me! You may so in the end. My mother told me just how he would woo, As if she sat in’s heart. She says all men Have the like oaths. He had sworn to marry me When his wife’s dead; therefore I’ll lie with him When I am buried. Since Frenchmen are so braid, Marry that will, I live and die a maid. Only, in this disguise, I think’t no sin To cozen him that would unjustly win.   [_Exit._]  SCENE III. The Florentine camp.   Enter the two French Lords and two or three Soldiers.  FIRST LORD. You have not given him his mother’s letter?  SECOND LORD. I have deliv’red it an hour since; there is something in’t that stings his nature; for on the reading it, he chang’d almost into another man.  FIRST LORD. He has much worthy blame laid upon him for shaking off so good a wife and so sweet a lady.  SECOND LORD. Especially he hath incurred the everlasting displeasure of the king, who had even tun’d his bounty to sing happiness to him. I will tell you a thing, but you shall let it dwell darkly with you.  FIRST LORD. When you have spoken it, ’tis dead, and I am the grave of it.  SECOND LORD. He hath perverted a young gentlewoman here in Florence, of a most chaste renown, and this night he fleshes his will in the spoil of her honour; he hath given her his monumental ring, and thinks himself made in the unchaste composition.  FIRST LORD. Now, God delay our rebellion! As we are ourselves, what things are we!  SECOND LORD. Merely our own traitors. And as in the common course of all treasons, we still see them reveal themselves till they attain to their abhorr’d ends; so he that in this action contrives against his own nobility, in his proper stream, o’erflows himself.  FIRST LORD. Is it not meant damnable in us to be trumpeters of our unlawful intents? We shall not then have his company tonight?  SECOND LORD. Not till after midnight; for he is dieted to his hour.  FIRST LORD. That approaches apace. I would gladly have him see his company anatomized, that he might take a measure of his own judgments, wherein so curiously he had set this counterfeit.  SECOND LORD. We will not meddle with him till he come; for his presence must be the whip of the other.  FIRST LORD. In the meantime, what hear you of these wars?  SECOND LORD. I hear there is an overture of peace.  FIRST LORD. Nay, I assure you, a peace concluded.  SECOND LORD. What will Count Rossillon do then? Will he travel higher, or return again into France?  FIRST LORD. I perceive by this demand, you are not altogether of his council.  SECOND LORD. Let it be forbid, sir! So should I be a great deal of his act.  FIRST LORD. Sir, his wife some two months since fled from his house. Her pretence is a pilgrimage to Saint Jaques le Grand; which holy undertaking with most austere sanctimony she accomplished; and there residing, the tenderness of her nature became as a prey to her grief; in fine, made a groan of her last breath, and now she sings in heaven.  SECOND LORD. How is this justified?  FIRST LORD. The stronger part of it by her own letters, which makes her story true, even to the point of her death. Her death itself, which could not be her office to say is come, was faithfully confirm’d by the rector of the place.  SECOND LORD. Hath the count all this intelligence?  FIRST LORD. Ay, and the particular confirmations, point from point, to the full arming of the verity.  SECOND LORD. I am heartily sorry that he’ll be glad of this.  FIRST LORD. How mightily sometimes we make us comforts of our losses!  SECOND LORD. And how mightily some other times we drown our gain in tears! The great dignity that his valour hath here acquir’d for him shall at home be encountered with a shame as ample.  FIRST LORD. The web of our life is of a mingled yarn, good and ill together; our virtues would be proud if our faults whipped them not; and our crimes would despair if they were not cherish’d by our virtues.   Enter a Messenger.  How now? Where’s your master?  MESSENGER. He met the duke in the street, sir; of whom he hath taken a solemn leave: his lordship will next morning for France. The duke hath offered him letters of commendations to the king.  SECOND LORD. They shall be no more than needful there, if they were more than they can commend.   Enter Bertram.  FIRST LORD. They cannot be too sweet for the king’s tartness. Here’s his lordship now. How now, my lord, is’t not after midnight?  BERTRAM. I have tonight despatch’d sixteen businesses, a month’s length apiece; by an abstract of success: I have congied with the duke, done my adieu with his nearest; buried a wife, mourn’d for her, writ to my lady mother I am returning, entertained my convoy, and between these main parcels of despatch effected many nicer needs: the last was the greatest, but that I have not ended yet.  SECOND LORD. If the business be of any difficulty and this morning your departure hence, it requires haste of your lordship.  BERTRAM. I mean the business is not ended, as fearing to hear of it hereafter. But shall we have this dialogue between the Fool and the Soldier? Come, bring forth this counterfeit module has deceiv’d me like a double-meaning prophesier.  SECOND LORD. Bring him forth.   [_Exeunt Soldiers._]  Has sat i’ the stocks all night, poor gallant knave.  BERTRAM. No matter; his heels have deserv’d it, in usurping his spurs so long. How does he carry himself?  FIRST LORD. I have told your lordship already; the stocks carry him. But to answer you as you would be understood: he weeps like a wench that had shed her milk; he hath confessed himself to Morgan, whom he supposes to be a friar, from the time of his remembrance to this very instant disaster of his setting i’ the stocks. And what think you he hath confessed?  BERTRAM. Nothing of me, has he?  SECOND LORD. His confession is taken, and it shall be read to his face; if your lordship be in’t, as I believe you are, you must have the patience to hear it.   Enter Soldiers with Parolles.  BERTRAM. A plague upon him! muffled! he can say nothing of me; hush, hush!  FIRST LORD. Hoodman comes! _Portotartarossa._  FIRST SOLDIER. He calls for the tortures. What will you say without ’em?  PAROLLES. I will confess what I know without constraint. If ye pinch me like a pasty I can say no more.  FIRST SOLDIER. _Bosko chimurcho._  FIRST LORD. _Boblibindo chicurmurco._  FIRST SOLDIER. You are a merciful general. Our general bids you answer to what I shall ask you out of a note.  PAROLLES. And truly, as I hope to live.  FIRST SOLDIER. ‘First demand of him how many horse the duke is strong.’ What say you to that?  PAROLLES. Five or six thousand; but very weak and unserviceable: the troops are all scattered, and the commanders very poor rogues, upon my reputation and credit, and as I hope to live.  FIRST SOLDIER. Shall I set down your answer so?  PAROLLES. Do. I’ll take the sacrament on ’t, how and which way you will.  BERTRAM. All’s one to him. What a past-saving slave is this!  FIRST LORD. You are deceived, my lord; this is Monsieur Parolles, the gallant militarist (that was his own phrase), that had the whole theoric of war in the knot of his scarf, and the practice in the chape of his dagger.  SECOND LORD. I will never trust a man again for keeping his sword clean, nor believe he can have everything in him by wearing his apparel neatly.  FIRST SOLDIER. Well, that’s set down.  PAROLLES. ‘Five or six thousand horse’ I said—I will say true—or thereabouts, set down,—for I’ll speak truth.  FIRST LORD. He’s very near the truth in this.  BERTRAM. But I con him no thanks for’t in the nature he delivers it.  PAROLLES. Poor rogues, I pray you say.  FIRST SOLDIER. Well, that’s set down.  PAROLLES. I humbly thank you, sir; a truth’s a truth, the rogues are marvellous poor.  FIRST SOLDIER. ‘Demand of him of what strength they are a-foot.’ What say you to that?  PAROLLES. By my troth, sir, if I were to live this present hour, I will tell true. Let me see: Spurio, a hundred and fifty, Sebastian, so many; Corambus, so many; Jaques, so many; Guiltian, Cosmo, Lodowick, and Gratii, two hundred fifty each; mine own company, Chitopher, Vaumond, Bentii, two hundred fifty each: so that the muster-file, rotten and sound, upon my life, amounts not to fifteen thousand poll; half of the which dare not shake the snow from off their cassocks lest they shake themselves to pieces.  BERTRAM. What shall be done to him?  FIRST LORD. Nothing, but let him have thanks. Demand of him my condition, and what credit I have with the duke.  FIRST SOLDIER. Well, that’s set down. ‘You shall demand of him whether one Captain Dumaine be i’ the camp, a Frenchman; what his reputation is with the duke, what his valour, honesty and expertness in wars; or whether he thinks it were not possible with well-weighing sums of gold to corrupt him to a revolt.’ What say you to this? What do you know of it?  PAROLLES. I beseech you, let me answer to the particular of the inter’gatories. Demand them singly.  FIRST SOLDIER. Do you know this Captain Dumaine?  PAROLLES. I know him: he was a botcher’s ’prentice in Paris, from whence he was whipped for getting the shrieve’s fool with child, a dumb innocent that could not say him nay.   [_First Lord lifts up his hand in anger._]  BERTRAM. Nay, by your leave, hold your hands; though I know his brains are forfeit to the next tile that falls.  FIRST SOLDIER. Well, is this captain in the Duke of Florence’s camp?  PAROLLES. Upon my knowledge, he is, and lousy.  FIRST LORD. Nay, look not so upon me; we shall hear of your lordship anon.  FIRST SOLDIER. What is his reputation with the duke?  PAROLLES. The duke knows him for no other but a poor officer of mine, and writ to me this other day to turn him out o’ the band. I think I have his letter in my pocket.  FIRST SOLDIER. Marry, we’ll search.  PAROLLES. In good sadness, I do not know; either it is there or it is upon a file, with the duke’s other letters, in my tent.  FIRST SOLDIER. Here ’tis; here’s a paper; shall I read it to you?  PAROLLES. I do not know if it be it or no.  BERTRAM. Our interpreter does it well.  FIRST LORD. Excellently.  FIRST SOLDIER. [_Reads._] _Dian, the Count’s a fool, and full of gold._  PAROLLES. That is not the duke’s letter, sir; that is an advertisement to a proper maid in Florence, one Diana, to take heed of the allurement of one Count Rossillon, a foolish idle boy, but for all that very ruttish. I pray you, sir, put it up again.  FIRST SOLDIER. Nay, I’ll read it first by your favour.  PAROLLES. My meaning in’t, I protest, was very honest in the behalf of the maid; for I knew the young count to be a dangerous and lascivious boy, who is a whale to virginity, and devours up all the fry it finds.  BERTRAM. Damnable both sides rogue!  FIRST SOLDIER. [_Reads._] _When he swears oaths, bid him drop gold, and take it; After he scores, he never pays the score. Half won is match well made; match, and well make it; He ne’er pays after-debts, take it before. And say a soldier, ‘Dian,’ told thee this: Men are to mell with, boys are not to kiss; For count of this, the count’s a fool, I know it, Who pays before, but not when he does owe it. Thine, as he vow’d to thee in thine ear,_                                      PAROLLES.  BERTRAM. He shall be whipped through the army with this rhyme in’s forehead.  SECOND LORD. This is your devoted friend, sir, the manifold linguist, and the armipotent soldier.  BERTRAM. I could endure anything before but a cat, and now he’s a cat to me.  FIRST SOLDIER. I perceive, sir, by our general’s looks we shall be fain to hang you.  PAROLLES. My life, sir, in any case. Not that I am afraid to die, but that, my offences being many, I would repent out the remainder of nature. Let me live, sir, in a dungeon, i’ the stocks, or anywhere, so I may live.  FIRST SOLDIER. We’ll see what may be done, so you confess freely. Therefore, once more to this Captain Dumaine: you have answer’d to his reputation with the duke, and to his valour. What is his honesty?  PAROLLES. He will steal, sir, an egg out of a cloister: for rapes and ravishments he parallels Nessus. He professes not keeping of oaths; in breaking them he is stronger than Hercules. He will lie, sir, with such volubility that you would think truth were a fool: drunkenness is his best virtue, for he will be swine-drunk, and in his sleep he does little harm, save to his bedclothes about him; but they know his conditions and lay him in straw. I have but little more to say, sir, of his honesty; he has everything that an honest man should not have; what an honest man should have, he has nothing.  FIRST LORD. I begin to love him for this.  BERTRAM. For this description of thine honesty? A pox upon him for me, he’s more and more a cat.  FIRST SOLDIER. What say you to his expertness in war?  PAROLLES. Faith, sir, has led the drum before the English tragedians,—to belie him I will not,—and more of his soldiership I know not, except in that country he had the honour to be the officer at a place there called Mile-end, to instruct for the doubling of files. I would do the man what honour I can, but of this I am not certain.  FIRST LORD. He hath out-villain’d villainy so far that the rarity redeems him.  BERTRAM. A pox on him! He’s a cat still.  FIRST SOLDIER. His qualities being at this poor price, I need not to ask you if gold will corrupt him to revolt.  PAROLLES. Sir, for a quart d’ecu he will sell the fee-simple of his salvation, the inheritance of it, and cut the entail from all remainders, and a perpetual succession for it perpetually.  FIRST SOLDIER. What’s his brother, the other Captain Dumaine?  SECOND LORD. Why does he ask him of me?  FIRST SOLDIER. What’s he?  PAROLLES. E’en a crow o’ the same nest; not altogether so great as the first in goodness, but greater a great deal in evil. He excels his brother for a coward, yet his brother is reputed one of the best that is. In a retreat he outruns any lackey; marry, in coming on he has the cramp.  FIRST SOLDIER. If your life be saved, will you undertake to betray the Florentine?  PAROLLES. Ay, and the captain of his horse, Count Rossillon.  FIRST SOLDIER. I’ll whisper with the general, and know his pleasure.  PAROLLES. [_Aside._] I’ll no more drumming; a plague of all drums! Only to seem to deserve well, and to beguile the supposition of that lascivious young boy the count, have I run into this danger: yet who would have suspected an ambush where I was taken?  FIRST SOLDIER. There is no remedy, sir, but you must die. The general says you that have so traitorously discovered the secrets of your army, and made such pestiferous reports of men very nobly held, can serve the world for no honest use; therefore you must die. Come, headsman, off with his head.  PAROLLES. O Lord! sir, let me live, or let me see my death.  FIRST SOLDIER. That shall you, and take your leave of all your friends.   [_Unmuffling him._]  So, look about you; know you any here?  BERTRAM. Good morrow, noble captain.  SECOND LORD. God bless you, Captain Parolles.  FIRST LORD. God save you, noble captain.  SECOND LORD. Captain, what greeting will you to my Lord Lafew? I am for France.  FIRST LORD. Good Captain, will you give me a copy of the sonnet you writ to Diana in behalf of the Count Rossillon? And I were not a very coward I’d compel it of you; but fare you well.   [_Exeunt Bertram, Lords &c._]  FIRST SOLDIER. You are undone, captain: all but your scarf; that has a knot on’t yet.  PAROLLES. Who cannot be crushed with a plot?  FIRST SOLDIER. If you could find out a country where but women were that had received so much shame, you might begin an impudent nation. Fare ye well, sir. I am for France too; we shall speak of you there.   [_Exeunt._]  PAROLLES. Yet am I thankful. If my heart were great ’Twould burst at this. Captain I’ll be no more, But I will eat, and drink, and sleep as soft As captain shall. Simply the thing I am Shall make me live. Who knows himself a braggart, Let him fear this; for it will come to pass That every braggart shall be found an ass. Rust, sword; cool, blushes; and, Parolles live Safest in shame; being fool’d, by foolery thrive. There’s place and means for every man alive. I’ll after them.   [_Exit._]  SCENE IV. Florence. A room in the Widow’s house.   Enter Helena, Widow and Diana.  HELENA. That you may well perceive I have not wrong’d you One of the greatest in the Christian world Shall be my surety; fore whose throne ’tis needful, Ere I can perfect mine intents, to kneel. Time was I did him a desired office, Dear almost as his life; which gratitude Through flinty Tartar’s bosom would peep forth, And answer thanks. I duly am inform’d His grace is at Marseilles; to which place We have convenient convoy. You must know I am supposed dead. The army breaking, My husband hies him home, where, heaven aiding, And by the leave of my good lord the king, We’ll be before our welcome.  WIDOW. Gentle madam, You never had a servant to whose trust Your business was more welcome.  HELENA. Nor you, mistress, Ever a friend whose thoughts more truly labour To recompense your love. Doubt not but heaven Hath brought me up to be your daughter’s dower, As it hath fated her to be my motive And helper to a husband. But, O strange men! That can such sweet use make of what they hate, When saucy trusting of the cozen’d thoughts Defiles the pitchy night; so lust doth play With what it loathes, for that which is away. But more of this hereafter. You, Diana, Under my poor instructions yet must suffer Something in my behalf.  DIANA. Let death and honesty Go with your impositions, I am yours Upon your will to suffer.  HELENA. Yet, I pray you; But with the word the time will bring on summer, When briers shall have leaves as well as thorns, And be as sweet as sharp. We must away; Our waggon is prepar’d, and time revives us. All’s well that ends well; still the fine’s the crown. Whate’er the course, the end is the renown.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE V. Rossillon. A room in the Countess’s palace.   Enter Clown, Countess and Lafew.  LAFEW. No, no, no, your son was misled with a snipt-taffeta fellow there, whose villanous saffron would have made all the unbak’d and doughy youth of a nation in his colour. Your daughter-in-law had been alive at this hour, and your son here at home, more advanc’d by the king than by that red-tail’d humble-bee I speak of.  COUNTESS. I would I had not known him; it was the death of the most virtuous gentlewoman that ever nature had praise for creating. If she had partaken of my flesh and cost me the dearest groans of a mother, I could not have owed her a more rooted love.  LAFEW. ’Twas a good lady, ’twas a good lady. We may pick a thousand salads ere we light on such another herb.  CLOWN. Indeed, sir, she was the sweet marjoram of the salad, or, rather, the herb of grace.  LAFEW. They are not herbs, you knave; they are nose-herbs.  CLOWN. I am no great Nebuchadnezzar, sir; I have not much skill in grass.  LAFEW. Whether dost thou profess thyself,—a knave or a fool?  CLOWN. A fool, sir, at a woman’s service, and a knave at a man’s.  LAFEW. Your distinction?  CLOWN. I would cozen the man of his wife, and do his service.  LAFEW. So you were a knave at his service indeed.  CLOWN. And I would give his wife my bauble, sir, to do her service.  LAFEW. I will subscribe for thee; thou art both knave and fool.  CLOWN. At your service.  LAFEW. No, no, no.  CLOWN. Why, sir, if I cannot serve you, I can serve as great a prince as you are.  LAFEW. Who’s that? a Frenchman?  CLOWN. Faith, sir, ’a has an English name; but his phisnomy is more hotter in France than there.  LAFEW. What prince is that?  CLOWN. The black prince, sir; alias the prince of darkness; alias the devil.  LAFEW. Hold thee, there’s my purse. I give thee not this to suggest thee from thy master thou talk’st of; serve him still.  CLOWN. I am a woodland fellow, sir, that always loved a great fire, and the master I speak of ever keeps a good fire. But sure he is the prince of the world; let his nobility remain in’s court. I am for the house with the narrow gate, which I take to be too little for pomp to enter: some that humble themselves may, but the many will be too chill and tender, and they’ll be for the flow’ry way that leads to the broad gate and the great fire.  LAFEW. Go thy ways, I begin to be a-weary of thee; and I tell thee so before, because I would not fall out with thee. Go thy ways; let my horses be well look’d to, without any tricks.  CLOWN. If I put any tricks upon ’em, sir, they shall be jades’ tricks, which are their own right by the law of nature.   [_Exit._]  LAFEW. A shrewd knave, and an unhappy.  COUNTESS. So he is. My lord that’s gone made himself much sport out of him; by his authority he remains here, which he thinks is a patent for his sauciness; and indeed he has no pace, but runs where he will.  LAFEW. I like him well; ’tis not amiss. And I was about to tell you, since I heard of the good lady’s death, and that my lord your son was upon his return home, I moved the king my master to speak in the behalf of my daughter; which, in the minority of them both, his majesty out of a self-gracious remembrance did first propose. His highness hath promis’d me to do it; and, to stop up the displeasure he hath conceived against your son, there is no fitter matter. How does your ladyship like it?  COUNTESS. With very much content, my lord, and I wish it happily effected.  LAFEW. His highness comes post from Marseilles, of as able body as when he number’d thirty; he will be here tomorrow, or I am deceived by him that in such intelligence hath seldom fail’d.  COUNTESS. It rejoices me that I hope I shall see him ere I die. I have letters that my son will be here tonight. I shall beseech your lordship to remain with me till they meet together.  LAFEW. Madam, I was thinking with what manners I might safely be admitted.  COUNTESS. You need but plead your honourable privilege.  LAFEW. Lady, of that I have made a bold charter; but, I thank my God, it holds yet.   Enter Clown.  CLOWN. O madam, yonder’s my lord your son with a patch of velvet on’s face; whether there be a scar under’t or no, the velvet knows; but ’tis a goodly patch of velvet. His left cheek is a cheek of two pile and a half, but his right cheek is worn bare.  LAFEW. A scar nobly got, or a noble scar, is a good livery of honour; so belike is that.  CLOWN. But it is your carbonado’d face.  LAFEW. Let us go see your son, I pray you. I long to talk with the young noble soldier.  CLOWN. Faith, there’s a dozen of ’em, with delicate fine hats, and most courteous feathers, which bow the head and nod at every man.   [_Exeunt._]   ACT V.  SCENE I. Marseilles. A street.   Enter Helena, Widow and Diana with two Attendants.  HELENA. But this exceeding posting day and night Must wear your spirits low. We cannot help it. But since you have made the days and nights as one, To wear your gentle limbs in my affairs, Be bold you do so grow in my requital As nothing can unroot you. In happy time;—   Enter a Gentleman.  This man may help me to his majesty’s ear, If he would spend his power. God save you, sir.  GENTLEMAN. And you.  HELENA. Sir, I have seen you in the court of France.  GENTLEMAN. I have been sometimes there.  HELENA. I do presume, sir, that you are not fallen From the report that goes upon your goodness; And therefore, goaded with most sharp occasions, Which lay nice manners by, I put you to The use of your own virtues, for the which I shall continue thankful.  GENTLEMAN. What’s your will?  HELENA. That it will please you To give this poor petition to the king, And aid me with that store of power you have To come into his presence.  GENTLEMAN. The king’s not here.  HELENA. Not here, sir?  GENTLEMAN. Not indeed. He hence remov’d last night, and with more haste Than is his use.  WIDOW. Lord, how we lose our pains!  HELENA. All’s well that ends well yet, Though time seem so adverse and means unfit. I do beseech you, whither is he gone?  GENTLEMAN. Marry, as I take it, to Rossillon; Whither I am going.  HELENA. I do beseech you, sir, Since you are like to see the king before me, Commend the paper to his gracious hand, Which I presume shall render you no blame, But rather make you thank your pains for it. I will come after you with what good speed Our means will make us means.  GENTLEMAN. This I’ll do for you.  HELENA. And you shall find yourself to be well thank’d, Whate’er falls more. We must to horse again. Go, go, provide.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE II. Rossillon. The inner court of the Countess’s palace.   Enter Clown and Parolles.  PAROLLES. Good Monsieur Lavache, give my Lord Lafew this letter; I have ere now, sir, been better known to you, when I have held familiarity with fresher clothes; but I am now, sir, muddied in Fortune’s mood, and smell somewhat strong of her strong displeasure.  CLOWN. Truly, Fortune’s displeasure is but sluttish, if it smell so strongly as thou speak’st of. I will henceforth eat no fish of Fortune’s buttering. Pr’ythee, allow the wind.  PAROLLES. Nay, you need not to stop your nose, sir. I spake but by a metaphor.  CLOWN. Indeed, sir, if your metaphor stink, I will stop my nose, or against any man’s metaphor. Pr’ythee, get thee further.  PAROLLES. Pray you, sir, deliver me this paper.  CLOWN. Foh, pr’ythee stand away. A paper from Fortune’s close-stool to give to a nobleman! Look here he comes himself.   Enter Lafew.  Here is a pur of Fortune’s, sir, or of Fortune’s cat, but not a musk-cat, that has fallen into the unclean fishpond of her displeasure, and as he says, is muddied withal. Pray you, sir, use the carp as you may, for he looks like a poor, decayed, ingenious, foolish, rascally knave. I do pity his distress in my similes of comfort, and leave him to your lordship.   [_Exit._]  PAROLLES. My lord, I am a man whom Fortune hath cruelly scratch’d.  LAFEW. And what would you have me to do? ’Tis too late to pare her nails now. Wherein have you played the knave with Fortune that she should scratch you, who of herself is a good lady, and would not have knaves thrive long under her? There’s a quart d’ecu for you. Let the justices make you and Fortune friends; I am for other business.  PAROLLES. I beseech your honour to hear me one single word.  LAFEW. You beg a single penny more. Come, you shall ha’t; save your word.  PAROLLES. My name, my good lord, is Parolles.  LAFEW. You beg more than word then. Cox my passion! Give me your hand. How does your drum?  PAROLLES. O my good lord, you were the first that found me.  LAFEW. Was I, in sooth? And I was the first that lost thee.  PAROLLES. It lies in you, my lord, to bring me in some grace, for you did bring me out.  LAFEW. Out upon thee, knave! dost thou put upon me at once both the office of God and the devil? One brings the in grace, and the other brings thee out.   [_Trumpets sound._]  The king’s coming; I know by his trumpets. Sirrah, inquire further after me. I had talk of you last night; though you are a fool and a knave, you shall eat. Go to; follow.  PAROLLES. I praise God for you.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE III. The same. A room in the Countess’s palace.   Flourish. Enter King, Countess, Lafew, Lords, Gentlemen, Guards &c.  KING. We lost a jewel of her, and our esteem Was made much poorer by it; but your son, As mad in folly, lack’d the sense to know Her estimation home.  COUNTESS. ’Tis past, my liege, And I beseech your majesty to make it Natural rebellion, done i’ the blaze of youth, When oil and fire, too strong for reason’s force, O’erbears it and burns on.  KING. My honour’d lady, I have forgiven and forgotten all, Though my revenges were high bent upon him, And watch’d the time to shoot.  LAFEW. This I must say,— But first, I beg my pardon,—the young lord Did to his majesty, his mother, and his lady, Offence of mighty note; but to himself The greatest wrong of all. He lost a wife Whose beauty did astonish the survey Of richest eyes; whose words all ears took captive; Whose dear perfection hearts that scorn’d to serve Humbly call’d mistress.  KING. Praising what is lost Makes the remembrance dear. Well, call him hither; We are reconcil’d, and the first view shall kill All repetition. Let him not ask our pardon; The nature of his great offence is dead, And deeper than oblivion do we bury Th’ incensing relics of it. Let him approach A stranger, no offender; and inform him So ’tis our will he should.  GENTLEMAN. I shall, my liege.   [_Exit Gentleman._]  KING. What says he to your daughter? Have you spoke?  LAFEW. All that he is hath reference to your highness.  KING. Then shall we have a match. I have letters sent me That sets him high in fame.   Enter Bertram.  LAFEW. He looks well on ’t.  KING. I am not a day of season, For thou mayst see a sunshine and a hail In me at once. But to the brightest beams Distracted clouds give way; so stand thou forth; The time is fair again.  BERTRAM. My high-repented blames Dear sovereign, pardon to me.  KING. All is whole. Not one word more of the consumed time. Let’s take the instant by the forward top; For we are old, and on our quick’st decrees Th’inaudible and noiseless foot of time Steals ere we can effect them. You remember The daughter of this lord?  BERTRAM. Admiringly, my liege. At first I stuck my choice upon her, ere my heart Durst make too bold herald of my tongue: Where the impression of mine eye infixing, Contempt his scornful perspective did lend me, Which warp’d the line of every other favour, Scorn’d a fair colour, or express’d it stolen, Extended or contracted all proportions To a most hideous object. Thence it came That she whom all men prais’d, and whom myself, Since I have lost, have lov’d, was in mine eye The dust that did offend it.  KING. Well excus’d: That thou didst love her, strikes some scores away From the great compt: but love that comes too late, Like a remorseful pardon slowly carried, To the great sender turns a sour offence, Crying, That’s good that’s gone. Our rash faults Make trivial price of serious things we have, Not knowing them until we know their grave. Oft our displeasures, to ourselves unjust, Destroy our friends, and after weep their dust: Our own love waking cries to see what’s done, While shameful hate sleeps out the afternoon. Be this sweet Helen’s knell, and now forget her. Send forth your amorous token for fair Maudlin. The main consents are had, and here we’ll stay To see our widower’s second marriage-day.  COUNTESS. Which better than the first, O dear heaven, bless! Or, ere they meet, in me, O nature, cesse!  LAFEW. Come on, my son, in whom my house’s name Must be digested; give a favour from you, To sparkle in the spirits of my daughter, That she may quickly come.   [_Bertram gives a ring to Lafew._]  By my old beard, And ev’ry hair that’s on ’t, Helen that’s dead Was a sweet creature: such a ring as this, The last that e’er I took her leave at court, I saw upon her finger.  BERTRAM. Hers it was not.  KING. Now, pray you, let me see it; for mine eye, While I was speaking, oft was fasten’d to it. This ring was mine; and when I gave it Helen I bade her, if her fortunes ever stood Necessitied to help, that by this token I would relieve her. Had you that craft to ’reave her Of what should stead her most?  BERTRAM. My gracious sovereign, Howe’er it pleases you to take it so, The ring was never hers.  COUNTESS. Son, on my life, I have seen her wear it; and she reckon’d it At her life’s rate.  LAFEW. I am sure I saw her wear it.  BERTRAM. You are deceiv’d, my lord; she never saw it. In Florence was it from a casement thrown me, Wrapp’d in a paper, which contain’d the name Of her that threw it. Noble she was, and thought I stood engag’d; but when I had subscrib’d To mine own fortune, and inform’d her fully I could not answer in that course of honour As she had made the overture, she ceas’d, In heavy satisfaction, and would never Receive the ring again.  KING. Plutus himself, That knows the tinct and multiplying medicine, Hath not in nature’s mystery more science Than I have in this ring. ’Twas mine, ’twas Helen’s, Whoever gave it you. Then if you know That you are well acquainted with yourself, Confess ’twas hers, and by what rough enforcement You got it from her. She call’d the saints to surety That she would never put it from her finger Unless she gave it to yourself in bed, Where you have never come, or sent it us Upon her great disaster.  BERTRAM. She never saw it.  KING. Thou speak’st it falsely, as I love mine honour, And mak’st conjectural fears to come into me Which I would fain shut out. If it should prove That thou art so inhuman,—’twill not prove so: And yet I know not, thou didst hate her deadly. And she is dead; which nothing but to close Her eyes myself, could win me to believe More than to see this ring. Take him away.   [_Guards seize Bertram._]  My fore-past proofs, howe’er the matter fall, Shall tax my fears of little vanity, Having vainly fear’d too little. Away with him. We’ll sift this matter further.  BERTRAM. If you shall prove This ring was ever hers, you shall as easy Prove that I husbanded her bed in Florence, Where she yet never was.   [_Exit, guarded._]  KING. I am wrapp’d in dismal thinkings.   Enter a Gentleman.  GENTLEMAN. Gracious sovereign, Whether I have been to blame or no, I know not: Here’s a petition from a Florentine, Who hath for four or five removes come short To tender it herself. I undertook it, Vanquish’d thereto by the fair grace and speech Of the poor suppliant, who by this, I know, Is here attending: her business looks in her With an importing visage, and she told me In a sweet verbal brief, it did concern Your highness with herself.  KING. [_Reads._] _Upon his many protestations to marry me when his wife was dead, I blush to say it, he won me. Now is the Count Rossillon a widower; his vows are forfeited to me, and my honour’s paid to him. He stole from Florence, taking no leave, and I follow him to his country for justice. Grant it me, O king, in you it best lies; otherwise a seducer flourishes, and a poor maid is undone._                                     DIANA CAPILET.  LAFEW. I will buy me a son-in-law in a fair, and toll for this. I’ll none of him.  KING. The heavens have thought well on thee, Lafew, To bring forth this discovery. Seek these suitors. Go speedily, and bring again the count.   [_Exeunt Gentleman and some Attendants._]  I am afeard the life of Helen, lady, Was foully snatch’d.  COUNTESS. Now, justice on the doers!   Enter Bertram, guarded.  KING. I wonder, sir, since wives are monsters to you, And that you fly them as you swear them lordship, Yet you desire to marry. What woman’s that?   Enter Widow and Diana.  DIANA. I am, my lord, a wretched Florentine, Derived from the ancient Capilet; My suit, as I do understand, you know, And therefore know how far I may be pitied.  WIDOW. I am her mother, sir, whose age and honour Both suffer under this complaint we bring, And both shall cease, without your remedy.  KING. Come hither, count; do you know these women?  BERTRAM. My lord, I neither can nor will deny But that I know them. Do they charge me further?  DIANA. Why do you look so strange upon your wife?  BERTRAM. She’s none of mine, my lord.  DIANA. If you shall marry, You give away this hand, and that is mine, You give away heaven’s vows, and those are mine, You give away myself, which is known mine; For I by vow am so embodied yours That she which marries you must marry me, Either both or none.  LAFEW. [_To Bertram_] Your reputation comes too short for my daughter; you are no husband for her.  BERTRAM. My lord, this is a fond and desperate creature Whom sometime I have laugh’d with. Let your highness Lay a more noble thought upon mine honour Than for to think that I would sink it here.  KING. Sir, for my thoughts, you have them ill to friend Till your deeds gain them; fairer prove your honour Than in my thought it lies!  DIANA. Good my lord, Ask him upon his oath, if he does think He had not my virginity.  KING. What say’st thou to her?  BERTRAM. She’s impudent, my lord, And was a common gamester to the camp.  DIANA. He does me wrong, my lord; if I were so He might have bought me at a common price. Do not believe him. O, behold this ring, Whose high respect and rich validity Did lack a parallel; yet for all that He gave it to a commoner o’ the camp, If I be one.  COUNTESS. He blushes, and ’tis it. Of six preceding ancestors, that gem Conferr’d by testament to th’ sequent issue, Hath it been owed and worn. This is his wife; That ring’s a thousand proofs.  KING. Methought you said You saw one here in court could witness it.  DIANA. I did, my lord, but loath am to produce So bad an instrument; his name’s Parolles.  LAFEW. I saw the man today, if man he be.  KING. Find him, and bring him hither.   [_Exit an Attendant._]  BERTRAM. What of him? He’s quoted for a most perfidious slave, With all the spots o’ the world tax’d and debauch’d: Whose nature sickens but to speak a truth. Am I or that or this for what he’ll utter, That will speak anything?  KING. She hath that ring of yours.  BERTRAM. I think she has. Certain it is I lik’d her And boarded her i’ the wanton way of youth. She knew her distance, and did angle for me, Madding my eagerness with her restraint, As all impediments in fancy’s course Are motives of more fancy; and in fine, Her infinite cunning with her modern grace, Subdu’d me to her rate; she got the ring, And I had that which any inferior might At market-price have bought.  DIANA. I must be patient. You that have turn’d off a first so noble wife May justly diet me. I pray you yet,— Since you lack virtue, I will lose a husband— Send for your ring, I will return it home, And give me mine again.  BERTRAM. I have it not.  KING. What ring was yours, I pray you?  DIANA. Sir, much like The same upon your finger.  KING. Know you this ring? This ring was his of late.  DIANA. And this was it I gave him, being abed.  KING. The story then goes false you threw it him Out of a casement.  DIANA. I have spoke the truth.   Enter Attendant with Parolles.  BERTRAM. My lord, I do confess the ring was hers.  KING. You boggle shrewdly; every feather starts you. Is this the man you speak of?  DIANA. Ay, my lord.  KING. Tell me, sirrah, but tell me true I charge you, Not fearing the displeasure of your master, Which on your just proceeding, I’ll keep off,— By him and by this woman here what know you?  PAROLLES. So please your majesty, my master hath been an honourable gentleman. Tricks he hath had in him, which gentlemen have.  KING. Come, come, to the purpose. Did he love this woman?  PAROLLES. Faith, sir, he did love her; but how?  KING. How, I pray you?  PAROLLES. He did love her, sir, as a gentleman loves a woman.  KING. How is that?  PAROLLES. He lov’d her, sir, and lov’d her not.  KING. As thou art a knave and no knave. What an equivocal companion is this!  PAROLLES. I am a poor man, and at your majesty’s command.  LAFEW. He’s a good drum, my lord, but a naughty orator.  DIANA. Do you know he promised me marriage?  PAROLLES. Faith, I know more than I’ll speak.  KING. But wilt thou not speak all thou know’st?  PAROLLES. Yes, so please your majesty. I did go between them as I said; but more than that, he loved her, for indeed he was mad for her, and talked of Satan, and of Limbo, and of furies, and I know not what: yet I was in that credit with them at that time that I knew of their going to bed; and of other motions, as promising her marriage, and things which would derive me ill will to speak of; therefore I will not speak what I know.  KING. Thou hast spoken all already, unless thou canst say they are married; but thou art too fine in thy evidence; therefore stand aside. This ring, you say, was yours?  DIANA. Ay, my good lord.  KING. Where did you buy it? Or who gave it you?  DIANA. It was not given me, nor I did not buy it.  KING. Who lent it you?  DIANA. It was not lent me neither.  KING. Where did you find it then?  DIANA. I found it not.  KING. If it were yours by none of all these ways, How could you give it him?  DIANA. I never gave it him.  LAFEW. This woman’s an easy glove, my lord; she goes off and on at pleasure.  KING. This ring was mine, I gave it his first wife.  DIANA. It might be yours or hers for ought I know.  KING. Take her away, I do not like her now. To prison with her. And away with him. Unless thou tell’st me where thou hadst this ring, Thou diest within this hour.  DIANA. I’ll never tell you.  KING. Take her away.  DIANA. I’ll put in bail, my liege.  KING. I think thee now some common customer.  DIANA. By Jove, if ever I knew man, ’twas you.  KING. Wherefore hast thou accus’d him all this while?  DIANA. Because he’s guilty, and he is not guilty. He knows I am no maid, and he’ll swear to’t: I’ll swear I am a maid, and he knows not. Great King, I am no strumpet, by my life; I am either maid, or else this old man’s wife.   [_Pointing to Lafew._]  KING. She does abuse our ears; to prison with her.  DIANA. Good mother, fetch my bail. Stay, royal sir;   [_Exit Widow._]  The jeweller that owes the ring is sent for, And he shall surety me. But for this lord Who hath abus’d me as he knows himself, Though yet he never harm’d me, here I quit him. He knows himself my bed he hath defil’d; And at that time he got his wife with child. Dead though she be, she feels her young one kick; So there’s my riddle: one that’s dead is quick, And now behold the meaning.   Enter Widow with Helena.  KING. Is there no exorcist Beguiles the truer office of mine eyes? Is’t real that I see?  HELENA. No, my good lord; ’Tis but the shadow of a wife you see, The name, and not the thing.  BERTRAM. Both, both. O, pardon!  HELENA. O, my good lord, when I was like this maid; I found you wondrous kind. There is your ring, And, look you, here’s your letter. This it says, ‘When from my finger you can get this ring, And is by me with child, &c.’ This is done; Will you be mine now you are doubly won?  BERTRAM. If she, my liege, can make me know this clearly, I’ll love her dearly, ever, ever dearly.  HELENA. If it appear not plain, and prove untrue, Deadly divorce step between me and you! O my dear mother, do I see you living?  LAFEW. Mine eyes smell onions; I shall weep anon. [_to Parolles_] Good Tom Drum, lend me a handkercher. So, I thank thee. Wait on me home, I’ll make sport with thee. Let thy courtesies alone, they are scurvy ones.  KING. Let us from point to point this story know, To make the even truth in pleasure flow. [_To Diana._] If thou beest yet a fresh uncropped flower, Choose thou thy husband, and I’ll pay thy dower; For I can guess that by thy honest aid, Thou kept’st a wife herself, thyself a maid. Of that and all the progress more and less, Resolvedly more leisure shall express. All yet seems well, and if it end so meet, The bitter past, more welcome is the sweet.   [_Flourish._]  [EPILOGUE]  _The king’s a beggar, now the play is done; All is well ended if this suit be won, That you express content; which we will pay With strife to please you, day exceeding day. Ours be your patience then, and yours our parts; Your gentle hands lend us, and take our hearts._   [_Exeunt omnes._]'"
